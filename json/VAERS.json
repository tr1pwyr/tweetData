SIDS clearly depends on the vaccine given, because Rotavirus and Diphtheria are given on the exact same schedule. The reason these vaccines are so close is they are often given together at the same appointment. But even with that, there is still a 4 sigma increase. This is a REAL problem for anyone to explain away. WHOOPS!!!! The only explanation that fits is that vaccines cause SIDS. Maybe the people who write the \"community note\" can explain that :) \n\nBut they can't. NOBODY can. There is no place to hide folks. Vaccines cause SIDS.",

They offered several times and never heard back. So, they went in and asked in person,.....and the CDC said NO. They did not want it improved. \nWhy do you suppose they did that? DUH.",

        "text": "This does not explain how there were increased VAERS claims with specific \"hot batches\". In fact, it seems to confirm the reality of \"hot batches\" such that certain batches account for a disproportionate number of adverse claims with those batches.\n\nUnless the suggestion is that these apparent \"hot batches\" were delivered in specific geographic locations where people are prone to making VAERS claims. Which, from what I understand, is specifically not the case - that batches were delivered in geographically diverse locations, which makes the reporting on certain \"bot batches\" even more damning and undeniable.\n\nWhat's your next attempt to deny / minimize the VAERS data?",

IT HAS TO BE INTENTIONAL TO THE POINT OF NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE.\"\n\nVAERS AND DMED ARE \"SCREAMING AT US.\"\n\nIn this discussion with Charles Kovess (@CharlesKovess) et al., Army Flight Surgeon Dr. Theresa M. Long (@LTCTheresaLong) describes the horrors that have resulted from unleashing, and mandating, the COVID injections on the U.S. military. Long, who testified in a case challenging the military's COVID \"vaccination\" mandate and also holds a degree in public health*, discusses amongst many alarming topics, the claim that military members are \"dropping dead,\" service members \"who are horrifically debilitated,\" and the idea that there is \"an agenda that is far bigger than money behind all of this.\"\n\nIn this first clip, Long discusses the fact that both VAERS, the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, and DMED, the U.S. military's Defense Military Epidemiology Database (DMED), along with the VAERS data specific to the military, have all been \"screaming at us\" in regard to the dangers of the COVID injections.\n\nLong says people are now ignoring the danger signals \"to the point where... it can no longer be excused as incompetence. It has to be intentional to the point of negligent homicide.\"\n\nIndeed, it appears the injections are a bioweapon. Hear more about why that's the case from pharma insider Sasha Latypova: sensereceptornews.com/?p=159\u2026\n\n*lc.org/newsroom/details/0311\u2026",

        "text": "My safety questions, set #1, sent 5/2021:\n1. Am I the only one who is aware that there have been over 4,300 deaths and thousands of adverse reactions, from mild to severe, have been reported to the VAERS CDC database in the last 5 months from US COVID19 vaccinations alone (which is more deaths than all other reported deaths from all other vaccinations combined in the last 20 years)...and traditionally only about 1% of adverse events are reported to VAERS?\n2. On my team, Rhonda and Linda can attest, that many nurses have been hearing from members who are now having problems, some of them major, like muscle weakness, inability to walk, new severe pain to extremities, HA's, etc.  I watched ER docs testifying before the legislature yesterday regarding this subject and the fact that 15, 16, 17 year old kids, who were perfectly healthy before vaccination, are also among those reported deaths, and the fact that they are seeing more ER visits related to the vaccine, than to COVID19 infection right now.\nThey also said that people who have already had COVID, may not have antibodies, if they had strong tcell response, but that data is showing that those who have already had the virus, are 2-3x more likely to have a serious adverse event if they get vaccinated.\n\nI have not heard any discussion of any of this, and I don't understand why.  Is there going to be any discussion about the idea of vaccinating young healthy people, people who have had COVID19 and recovered, where we will talk about potential risks vs benefits of vaccination, and acknowledge there are risks to the vaccines, or is UHG just going to keep saying the vaccines are safe and effective and that everyone should get them regardless of the risk of mortality from the actual virus, and/or, to consult their doctors?\n\nSafety Questions, Set #2, sent 5/2021\n1. What is the evidence-based reason, we are promoting experimental products to healthy kids and other healthy people, who are not statistically at any risk?\n2. What is the evidence-based reason, we are promoting experimental products to people who have already recovered and now have natural immunity?  We don't encourage a flu shot after people recover from the flu.\n3. Can you tell us how do we report injuries to VAERS, and is it changing to FAERS through the FDA soon?\n4. Are there links we can refer patients to, that include information about the 13,000+ adverse events, and other more serious adverse reactions.  The CDC pages were suggesting only a couple of rare reactions happened, and were mainly warning of minor reactions.\n5. Can we share information about options for medical or religious exemptions for parents whose schools are requiring the experimental injections or for people who don't feel safe and don't want it?\n6. Is it true, that people who have natural immunity have a 2-3x increased risk of serious adverse reactions, as shown to you via the ER doctor testimony before the TX Legislature yesterday?  Is the J&J possibly a safer option for this subgroup?\n\nSafety questions, set #3, sent 7/2021 after finally getting a response that answered almost all the questions with: \"your resource is the CDC\"\n1.Many of my peers are not aware; have their been alerts to the staff about this, and I just missed them?  There are new warnings from the FDA that have been released in the last couple weeks about all 3 vaccines.  J&J is causing gullain-barre syndrome and they have already admitted a causal relationship to blood clot formation.  Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are causing myocarditis and pericarditis, mostly in young healthy males.  \n2.If you direct someone to the CDC.gov page, for possible side effects, it only lists minor side effects for the most part, briefly addresses blood clots and myocarditis, no mention of all the deaths (over 6,000) and adverse reactions being investigated, which seems quite disingenuous and does not allow you to see reported VAERS info.  I'm not sure where I'm allowed to direct people to actually see the VAERS information for reported deaths, paralysis, GBS, strokes, etc, if they have questions about side effects and possible risks, so could you help me find this on the CDC website? \n3. Also, I was watching the news and the Prime Minister from the UK said on 7/19/21, that 40% of their hospitalized COVID patients are \"double vaccinated.\"  (I know the CDC is saying that 99.5% of hospitalized patients are unvaccinated, but now I find this hard to believe), and J&J is now saying their shot isn't protective enough against Delta and newer variants...so booster may be needed.  Should we be educating our vaccinated patients about signs and symptoms of breakthrough infections, so they know to seek out testing and treatment early?\n\nJust a reminder, I am not anti-vaccine, at all.  I am pro-informed consent and pro-safety and I apologize for the many questions.",

Each Vial is different, scientists see no uniformity at all. And some batches are more deadly than others,....if you look at VAERS which only shows 1% of the actual injuries and deaths, you will find that certain batches had almost all of the quick injuries and deaths. The other batches do different things, one is to destroy your own immune system as I said above. (that doesn't CAUSE cancer, it allows the cancer cells we get all the time to survive. ) \nA new study today said that blindness has increased 300% in the vaxed. The Micro Clots are killing the brain cells (dementia) and the eye neurons (blindness). Tthe spike gets into the Placenenta and causes it to come off the Uterous, miscarriages are up over 800% in vaxed mothers. I don't even know what the shots are doing to new borns,...I'm scared to ask! These shots are meant to cull Humanity in so many different ways no one will tie them to all the deaths and injures. They think we won't realize what they've done.....they really think we are so stupid!",

I don't know about that.  But it certainly deserves further study.  \n\nExcess deaths in Canada, this morning @denisrancourt testified in front of the @Inquiry_Canada that he believes 10,000-35,000 died as a result of the injections.  So if this number holds, this means that yes, only a small portion (<10%) of actual deaths were reported to VAERS and CAERS.  Why that is, is subject to investigation.  I have my opinions. \n\nI ran into this graph below made from statistics Canada all cause mortality data that apparently talks about more than 7,000 excess deaths over expected (naturally expected) deaths in 2022.",

They expected 1K a day but ending up getting 30K a week which averages out to 6K a day assuming a 5 day-work week.\n\nIf you know anything about VAERS, you'll know that prior to the covid vaccine, you know that prior to 2020, VAERS only recorded about 100 vaccine deaths a year and that was for ALL vaccines.  Of course, we know from a 2009 Harvard study that only 1% of vaccine injuries are ever reported.  I'm sure the current VAERS numbers are very understated for the covid vaccine.\n\nconservativereview.com/horow\u2026",

        "text": "No winners to my $1,000 autism prospective comparison of autism rates of 3,000 fully vaxxed vs. 3,000 fully unvaxxed. If there were such a study, it would likely show a result very similar to the 4X in the Mawson study, the Control Group study (over 4X), or the VAERS ratio between the flu vs. MMR rates (slightly less than 4X but there are WAAAY more flu shots for most people by age 20). So showing the truth in a high quality study would be known by everyone. Since nobody knew of a quality study, it probably didn't exist (or everyone would know of it). So this wasn't a trick question at all. There are simply no high quality studies. The CDC launched one, but cancelled it. Nobody really wants to know the truth, do they? And the people who entered are NEVER going to call on the CDC for not doing this study. The study should track ALL adverse events. It would be epic. Since nobody is going to fund such a study, I will. Stay tuned to my substack.",

Period.  #FACT vaccine manufactures are not held liable for damages resulting from their products.\n\n#FACT Over$4 BILLION has been paid out for vaccine damages in a special vaccine court called VAERS, that was created after manufacturers were granted immunity from lawsuits.\n\n#FACT Diseases had already significantly declined PRIOR to the release of vaccines.\n\n#FACT Every manufacturer of pediatric vaccines has plead guilty to fraud.\n\n#FACT The United States Supreme Court declared vaccines to be \"unavoidably UNsafe.\"\n\n#FACT Doctors are paid bonuses for having high numbers of fully vaccinated patients. \n\n#FACT More people in the USA die each year as a direct result of vaccines, than of the diseases they are said to prevent.\n\n#FACT Vaccines contain significantly HIGHER levels of neurotoxins than what is considered safe by the FDA's standards.\n\n#FACT Throughout history, diseases have come and gone, well before vaccination.\n\n#FACT Despite the fact that there have been NO studies on the safety or effectiveness on vaccines in pregnant women, doctors still push pregnant women to receive vaccines that are not even recommended for newborns.\n\n#FACT Vaccine manufacturer inserts list SIDS, cancer, brain damage, and death as possible adverse reactions.\n\n#FACT Many diseases with seemingly \"unknown\" causes have risen significantly in recent years in correlation with the vaccine schedule. \n\n#FACT SIDS was almost unheard of prior to vaccination, but is now considered a major concern for parents of infants.\n\n#FACT Asthma, allergies, juvenile cancer, and type 1 diabetes were all uncommon occurrences prior to widespread vaccination, and are STILL uncommon among un Vaxxed populations, despite the significant increase among the vaccinated.\n\n#FACT Vaccines are NOT held to the same gold standard of scientific testing that all other pharmaceuticals are. Instead, they are treated to the same standards as cosmetics. \n\n#FACT The current vaccine schedule has NEVER been tested as a whole. While individual vaccines undergo some testing, combined doses have never been tested together, despite that fact that as many as 6-10 doses are typically given all at once. \n\n#FACT The USA has the most aggressive vaccine schedule, and also the highest rate of first day infant mortality, juvenile  cancer, and SIDS.\n\n#FACT The CDC owns the patents to over 20 vaccines, and sells around $4.6 BILLION worth of vaccines annually.\n\n#FACT Significantly more parents regret vaccinating than those who regret not vaccinating. \n\n#FACT Many studies suggest that unvaccinated children are healthier than even partially vaccinated children.",

They STILL told pregnant women to get the vaccine. \n\nCDC's John Su states in email in December 2021 on the Covid vaccine reports from VAERS: \"I'm noting we're seeing a fair bit of exposure by breastmilk. Also noting \"off label use\" and other indications of errors among children and teens...in reviewing reports among kids ages 5-11.\"\n\n[Off label use of vaccines means using an adult dose vaccine on a child when children's C-19 vaccines were not approved and available yet. Fear drove people to get their kids vaccinated with inappropriately dosed products.]\n\nDid you see a campaign from the CDC protecting kids from this? No. John Su was too busy waiting for his coffee to kick in to bother. See the email below.",

        "text": "As a Christian, I've noticed how Christianity is slowly dying out across America, and surprisingly, Christians themselves are contributing to this decline.\n\nIf you're a Christian reading this, ask yourself - how many times have we blamed our wrongdoings on the devil or some other external force? How many times have we refused to take responsibility for our actions and decisions? The truth is, if we want to keep our faith alive, we need to start practicing what we preach. We need to be more accountable for our actions and strive to follow the true values of Christianity - compassion, love, and forgiveness.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that sometimes when Christians stand up for marginalized communities like the LGBTQ+, they are told they need \"more Jesus\". But let me tell you, spreading love, kindness, and positivity should never be frowned upon, and it is what Jesus himself preached and embodied. So, instead of telling someone they need Jesus, ask yourself - could I be more kind, more forgiving, or more understanding? How can I show others the true values of Christianity through my actions? Let's stop blaming external forces and start taking responsibility for our actions, and practice what we preach. If we do this, we can create a better world.",

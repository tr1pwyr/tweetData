We will interview Nancy Pelosi.. former committee members. We have dedicated staff working on this\".\n\nHouse Republicans are creating a committee to \"reinvestigate\" the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.  \n\nMore than two months after the historic House Jan. 6 select committee disbanded and published its final report on the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, House Republicans are launching their own review of the Capitol riot.  \n\nThey plan to emphasize a different focus Jan. 6 with their panel. And the Georgia Republican who will chair the new panel is using the phrases \"investigate both sides\" and \"show what really happened on Jan. 6\" to describe the committee's work.\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk, Republican of Georgia, and chairman of the House Administration subcommittee on Oversight, said his panel will \"aggressively\" work to review the security failures that contributed to the breach of the Capitol on Jan. 6, and will investigate the conduct and performance of the prior House Jan. 6 select committee, which gathered millions of pages of documents and hundreds of interviews in 2021 and 2022, including with key members of the Trump inner circle.\n\n\"We have dedicated staff working on this,\" Loudermilk said.\n\nLoudermilk told CBS News his panel would consider seeking an interview with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi as part of its work, including any decisions made about Capitol security ahead of Jan. 6.  \n\n\"If we need to, we would like for her to come and talk to us about it,\" Loudermilk said.  He also raised the prospect of interviewing former members of the House select Jan. 6 committee.\n\nWhile she lauds the work of the House select Jan. 6 committee from last year, Loudermilk blisters the panel with criticism. He told CBS News, \"Americans have very little confidence in the report that they put out. And there's good reason. I mean, you even consider what they did to me, the false allegations that they made against me regarding the constituents that I had in my office in the office buildings \u2014 accusing me of giving reconnaissance tours.\"  \n\nLoudermilk said his panel would \"be honest, show the truth, show both sides.\" When pressed by CBS News about how Jan. 6 had \"two sides,\" Loudermilk reiterated his criticism about the scrutiny he was given for the tour group by the Jan. 6 select committee.",

        "text": "\u201cRepublicans have pushed back on claims that they are compromising security by sharing the footage. Last week, Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said Carlson\u2019s Fox News team was only allowed to view the tapes under a controlled setting and had to request footage, which would then go through a security review, before the production team could have a copy.\nDuring the Breitbart News interview, McCarthy again said a security team is reviewing the footage before sharing it with members of the news media or the broader public. McCarthy said the review is looking for various security details that would need to be protected, like special exits for lawmakers.\n\u201cThe most interesting thing, when I sat down, when I had the team talk to the Capitol police about making sure they had no problems with the exits and so on, they said [the Democrat-led Jan. 6 Committee], never asked them that,\u201d McCarthy told Breitbart, adding that the committee \u201cshowed the exit of the vice president, they showed the exit from my office, they literally had [then-House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi\u2019s daughter showing a secure location that they take the leadership. That\u2019s not supposed to be known to anybody, and CNN reported it, and I don\u2019t remember the press ever getting upset with that.\u201d \ud83e\uddf5\n\ntheepochtimes.com/mccarthy-a\u2026",

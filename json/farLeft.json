Oh, now I believe it's because Biden is going to attempt to run for president again, so a liberal, far-left leaning Institute of Learning wants to offer him an honorary degree to make him look better for a 2024  Campaign? Sorry, but he is not popular on both sides of the aisle, as they said. The ratings in various polls indicated this. The recent polls were at an all-time low for both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris! Every concerned American citizen knows this, except for them! They do not seem to  know, nor be concerned for the well-being of America. This is what they have shown us ever since Sleepy Joe came into the Oval Office. So, now is the time for sweeping changes to take place in America! It must happen and it is going to happen!  -LD  #share      \nBIDEN WAS AWARDED AN HONORARY DEGREE FROM HOWARD UNIVERSITY AND THE REASON WHY IS HILARIOUS!",

The far left can go too far on the rhetoric the far right is actively trying to destroy this republic, its institutions, and the constitution to make us at best an authoritarian government at worst a totalitarian one. J6 was a CW v2.0 salvo if the fires üî• of misinformation and hateful demonization of fellow citizens continue to be stoked I fear this republic will destroy itself from within, this great experiment will have failed because of lust for power and greed at the highest levels.

  "text": "To answer the question from @MorbiusDevo here:\n\nThe Far Left attribute stereotypes to being part of the very definition of race.  For example a black man who doesn't engage in stereotypical behavior is seen as less of a black man by them for it.  This is a result of Critical Race Theory arguing that race is a social construct.\n\nBasically the faults of George Floyd such as his criminal past are seen as examples of \"blackness\" to the Far Left and thus he is therefore a role model and idol to them in part because of those specific faults.",

  "text": "I think that Biden isn't really running the government.  There is a group of far-left people, including his wife, that are making the decisions and telling him what to say and do.  I think that the Speaker is in a tough position.  He either doesn't vote for a debt ceiling increase (and he gets demonized by the corrupt media) or allows a compromise to come to floor and gets removed as speaker.  If a compromise comes it will come from the Senate, although 44 Senators say that they only support what the House passed.  I'm for the House's bill because we need to rein in the debt which is too high and spending which is causing it.  Ultimately, I think that the government is going to shut down, and hopefully Yellen has a plan to keep the interest payments on the debt covered for the long run.",

  "text": "[from article]\nBut more surprising, perhaps, is the praise for Kennedy in certain quarters of the far left. The Grayzone‚Äôs Max Blumenthal and Aaron Mat√©, who have drifted to the conspiratorial fringe in recent years, celebrated Kennedy‚Äôs supposed ‚Äúanti-imperialist‚Äù opposition to American aid for Ukraine and argued that he threatens the ‚Äúpro-war‚Äù and ‚Äúpro-censorship‚Äù leadership of the Democratic Party. Briahna Joy Gray, co-host of The Hill‚Äôs show Rising and former press secretary for Bernie Sanders, favorably compared Kennedy to her former boss, calling the candidate an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù who presents a chance to ‚Äútopple the corporate duopoly.‚Äù\n\nWhat is going on here, exactly? Political science has a term for such surreal ideological alliances that would bewilder most rational voters: ‚Äúhorseshoe theory.‚Äù\n\nnewrepublic.com/article/1722‚Ä¶",

This is according to a measure of Right Wing Authoritarian social policy metrics.   \n\nBut I'd rather be far-right in the eyes of whoever wrote this article *for twitter*.\n\nLet's see. Okay -click- on the quote-retweet link, and then check for criticism on CityNews' site, check for Trudeau's movement (lack thereof) on the IRGC. \n\nLet's see. Here's one.\nvancouver.citynews.ca/2022/1‚Ä¶\n\nSo in the link above, CityNews is running cover for the see-hear-speak-no-evil position of the so-called \"Canadian Government\".  So, the most murderous government organization in the world is receiving explicit support from the \"Canadian Government\", and CityNews.\n\nThen, notice, CityNews isn't calling the groups, who want the IRGC to be listed as a terrorist group are labeled \"Far-right\", when they're criticizing Trudeau's tacit support.\n\nYet, the trucker protest in Ottawa?\n\nThe sitting Italian head of state?\n\nWhat about the Proud Boys? oooOOooH THEY'RE CERTAINLY TERRORISTS.  \n\nIRGC?  Let's discuss nuances.  Mass murder, sunday afternoon killings of women and children? Shh. Sweeping government support across the globe? Quiet!\nWe must be careful about how we label that, certainly.  Because you know, we are funded by the Canadian Government. Shh.  \n\nIs CityNews news? I don't think so, not even \"entertainment\", but most exclusively an advertising platform for the gov't.\n\nAlso, they have a typo in the fourth sentence of the link above about IRGC.",

Some times I sit down and I start crying because of all the harm and destruction the far-left laying in their footsteps and it is causing so much calamity. So many people dead or on the brink of starvation. Hard working people having their wealth seeped away from them so that people have to go to food banks and our youth not able to afford homes and the brain washing and over sexualizing of our young children. Entertainment completely politicized. I can't find a single good program on tv any more that does not have politics in it. And I am afraid it is only going to get worse before it gets better and I feel totally helpless. What am I supposed to do about it ?",

  "text": "As the far-left forces in the party gain even more power, though, there will be a tipping point where the moderates and conservatives in the Democratic coalition will either force the far-left to tame their positions, or will leave entirely. Prominent Democrat strategists are already sounding the alarm on how Democrats are losing voters of color and working-class voters. I expect to hear the ‚Äútransphobia is White supremacy‚Äù shtick a lot more in the future as trans activists brazenly try to make race-based appeals that just make them sound more stupid and power-hungry, while actual people of color see through the nonsense and either force Democrats off the brink of gender lunacy or just jump ship to Republicans. \n\nsocietystandpoint.substack.c‚Ä¶",

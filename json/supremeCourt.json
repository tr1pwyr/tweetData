There is one instance where filing must occur within 15 days \u2014 and another within 30 days. The 15-day rule would seem to apply to appellate court decisions \u2014 which would be the case here.

Most likely, the judge is also APC. \n\nAPC planned to rig the election and they knew Peter Obi would go to court, so they began planning who will judge the cases in court. That\u2019s why Keyamo kept saying that we will learn our lessons. \n\nMaking this woman\u2019s son to win the HOR is a small but important gift for such a big case.

Barnette (\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd7\ud835\udfd2\ud835\udfd1) case that the founders intended the Bill of Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities.\n\nAs the Court noted, the idea of the Bill of Rights \"was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.\" This is why \"fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\u201d\n\nAnd, many early state constitutions already acknowledged individual rights to self defense.\n\nE.G. Article I, Section 21 of the Pennsylvania State Constitution \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd5\ud835\udfd5\ud835\udfd4\nstates: \"The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned.\"",

        "text": "Trump would never have filed personal BK because it would have meant his personal finances be disclosed, and after the fight he took to the Supreme Court, he wasn't exactly willing to share those details.\n\nAnd you're right, businesses file all the time, however, the question of would you want this man running your company is still valid. When you are leveraging BK as a means of CYA, while causing job losses and financial losses to partners, leveraging BK for a business to rebuild and try again, or BK protections to help a business transition through tough times - those are why the system is in place.\n\nTo file 6 times, from the same guy with 6 different businesses is more of an abuse of the system - albeit legal and albeit businesses do/can get away with it, it is still a very immoral and unethical way to do business.\n\nWhen you bundle in the lack of personal financial disclosure, BK multiple businesses and cost the American Tax Payers $144 million on golf outings (after blasting previous presidents for wasting tax payer money), the bigger picture issue here is the double standard and hypocrisy that exists. \n\nDo you think that because someone has the money to afford tax lawyers (because they clearly are not paying into the business), is a fair action over the average American small business owner who cannot get a loan to keep his business afloat?\n\nDo you think it is ok for PPP loans in the millions to be forgiven to persons worth 7 figures, meanwhile small business was crushed during COVID and qualifications were few and far between?\n\nDo you think that someone having money/power somehow gives them a pass to making decisions based off good morals and values? \n\nThe most obvious answer is no, right? So if the answer is no, and \"that's just the way it is\", do you trust someone who uses the system \"the way it is\", to make it better for the average American?",

        "text": "Attached are pertinent sections of the May 9, 2023 Nigerian Supreme Court judgement in the Adeleke case concerning the Osun State Governorship Election. Based on the reasoning of the Court, it appears to bode well for the Obi-Datti petition. And a New Nigeria with @PeterObi as President is still POssible!\n\nThe Supreme Court found that the \"National Electronic Register of Election Results is a post election record and is not part of the election process.\" See p. 24. But in distinguishing the \"National Electronic Register of Election Results\" from other procedures that \"are operational during the election as part of the process,\" see id., the Court ultimately concluded that \"the Collation System and the INEC Result Viewing Portal are part of the election process and play particular roles in that process.\"\n\nFurther, the Supreme Court repeatedly relies on INEC's Guidelines as a basis for the judgement, finding that it is \"glaring from the above reproduced provisions of the Electoral Act and the INEC Regulations and Guidelines that the evidence required to prove that voting was allowed without accreditation or that there was improper accreditation are the Register of Voters, BVAS and the Polling Unit result in Form EC8A.\" See p. 17. This is a good omen for @PeterObi.\n\nFinally, while finding that \"the BVAS machine for each polling unit is the direct and primary record of the number of voters accredited in that polling unit on the election day in the process of the election,\" see p. 19, the Court also finds that INEC regulations \"provide for the BVAS to be used to scan the completed result in Form EC8A and transmit or upload the scanned copy of the polling unit result to the Collation System and INEC Result viewing Portal (IReV),\" see pp. 22-23.\n\nSince the failure to \"transmit or upload\" polling unit results is a foundational part of the Obi-Datti case, this finding by the Supreme Court is incredibly helpful as it holds INEC to its guidelines and regulations, particularly as it relates to the transmission of election results to the IReV. With this, we have no doubt that it is still POssible! Let's keep hope alive!",

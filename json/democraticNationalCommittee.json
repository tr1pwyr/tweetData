        "text": "The leadership of the Democratic party, as per certain claims, was allegedly cognizant and involved in a plot to remove JFK from his role, with a number of party members and some Republicans directly implicated. The current incarnation of the Democratic National Committee and its associated organizations is perceived to have drifted significantly towards the liberal extreme. Critics argue that they employ distraction, misinformation, corruption, and coercion as methods to disseminate their ideologies. Today, the party is seen by some as fostering conflict and pushing morally dubious narratives.\n\nMoreover, the party drew considerable criticism for its treatment of Tulsi Gabbard, who many believed to be the most qualified and potentially the ideal choice for the prosperity of the United States and the future of humanity as a whole. Despite her credentials, the party seemingly chose to perpetuate an agenda characterized by control and manipulation, leading to accusations of distancing themselves from the fundamental principles of the U.S. Constitution. This perceived disdain for the will of the people has compounded the perception of the party as being antagonistic towards the citizens they are supposed to represent.\n\nCritics argue that this approach by the Democratic party could have long-lasting repercussions for the United States and the global community. In overlooking a promising candidate like Tulsi Gabbard, critics argue that the party may have missed a chance to foster a more balanced and prosperous future. This decision is viewed by some as a misstep that could potentially affect the overall course of societal advancement and worldwide harmony.",

        "text": "In the vast tapestry of American history, there have been moments that stand out as some of the country's biggest blunders. One such blunder unfolded during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. It began as a seemingly ordinary break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex but quickly escalated into a national crisis that shook the foundations of American democracy. As investigations unraveled, it was revealed that the break-in was orchestrated by members of President Richard Nixon's administration, implicating the highest levels of power in a web of corruption, abuse of power, and attempts to cover up the truth. The scandal led to a loss of public trust in the presidency and ultimately culminated in Nixon's resignation, marking a dark chapter in American history.\n\nAnother significant blunder in American history was the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 based on faulty intelligence that claimed Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. This led to a protracted and costly war that resulted in the loss of thousands of American and Iraqi lives, destabilized the region, and sparked further unrest. The absence of the alleged weapons of mass destruction undermined the credibility of the intelligence community and raised questions about the justification for military intervention. The repercussions of this blunder continue to be felt today, highlighting the importance of sound decision-making and accurate information in matters of national security.\n\nFurthermore, the financial crisis of 2008 stands out as one of the biggest blunders in recent American history. It was triggered by a combination of risky lending practices, lax regulation, and excessive speculation in the housing market. The subsequent collapse of major financial institutions, coupled with a surge in foreclosures and unemployment, sent shockwaves throughout the global economy. Millions of Americans lost their homes, retirement savings, and jobs, while the effects of the crisis reverberated worldwide. The crisis exposed systemic weaknesses within the financial sector and raised questions about the need for stronger regulation and oversight.\n\nThese blunders serve as reminders of the fallibility of institutions and the importance of accountability, transparency, and critical thinking in shaping the course of a nation. By acknowledging and learning from these mistakes, America can strive to forge a brighter and more resilient future, guided by the lessons of its past.",

Two days after the release, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN that, according to \u201cexperts,\u201d Russian state actors had stolen the emails from the DNC and were releasing them through Wikileaks \u201cfor the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nMook did not use the word \u201ccollusion,\u201d but the press, in reporting his comments, did. Within the hour, in an article timestamped at 9:55 a.m., the Washington Examiner reported that Paul Manafort and Donald Trump Jr, had responded to Mook\u2019s allegations and \u201cvigorously denied any kind of collusion between Trump Sr. and the Russian president.\u201d\nlawfareblog.com/where-heck-d\u2026\n\nWhen former Attorney General Jeff Sessions told President Donald Trump that a special counsel had been appointed to conduct the Russia investigation, the president responded: \u201cOh my God.

        "text": "On this day in history 05/17/23. In 1973 the US Senate Watergate Committee begins its hearings into the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C.. The Senate Watergate Committee, known officially as the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, was a special committee established by the United States Senate, S.Res. 60, in 1973, to investigate the Watergate scandal, with the power to investigate the break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., and any subsequent cover-up of criminal activity, as well as \"all other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the controversial 1972 presidential election, including political espionage and campaign finance practices\". American print news media focused the nation's attention on the issue with hard-hitting investigative reports, while television news outlets brought the drama of the hearings to the living rooms of millions of American households, broadcasting the proceedings live for two weeks in May 1973. The public television network PBS broadcast the hearings from gavel to gavel on more than 150 national affiliates. Working under committee chairman Sam Ervin, the committee played a pivotal role in gathering evidence that would lead to the indictment of forty administration officials and the conviction of several of Richard Nixon's aides for obstruction of justice and other crimes. Its revelations later prompted the impeachment process against Nixon himself, which featured the introduction of three articles of impeachment by the Democratic-led House Committee on the Judiciary. Watergate led to Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974. Now you know.

        "text": "\ud83e\uddf5THREAD: The FBI worked as a disinformation outlet for Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee to frame Donald Trump as a Russian agent to sway the outcome of the 2016 election, and then they did it again with Hunter Biden's laptop during the 2020 election:\n\n\"What we learned today with the long-anticipated release of the Durham report is that the FBI worked as a disinformation shop for Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. Special Counsel John Durham's report shows us that the same people that lecture you today about threats to democracy nearly destroyed it by using our intelligence agencies to target the then-Republican nominee for president and then later sitting President Donald Trump. The entire story begins not by rigging an election against Donald Trump though it starts with rigging an election in support of Hillary Clinton.\n\nJust weeks before the FBI launched the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, WikiLeaks released 10s of 1000s of emails, proving the Democratic National Committee had rigged its 2016 primary in favor of Hillary Clinton. The victims here are Democratic voters and Bernie Sanders. The DNC and Hillary Clinton herself knew that that primary was rigged. They knew those emails were real. So together, they immediately worked to discredit the leaks. They immediately worked to discredit the idea that they rigged that Democratic primary and their plan to do so, dismiss it all as the contents of Russian propaganda and lay it there at the feet of Donald Trump.\n\nHillary Clinton, in my estimation, in the first smoking gun of the night personally approved a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisors to quote vilify Donald Trump, by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by Russian security services. There you have the plan. There you have the motive. Now then you go on according to Durham's report to see that US intelligence agencies knew in fact what Hillary was trying to trying to do. Almost immediately senior members of our intelligence community began acting on those allegations, treating them as fact. \n\nHere's some familiar names about CIA Director John Brennan, who briefed then President Barack Obama, his Vice President Joe Biden, and FBI Director James Comey, along with the Attorney General, briefed them all on Hillary's conspiracy theory to tie Trump to the DNC hack... The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through a firm called Fusion GPS paid a former British spy named Christopher Steele to compile intelligence to tie Trump to Russia. But the intelligence that fusion GPS put together was a series of scandalous, salacious, nothing burgers... The Durham Report is six years too late because the hoax worked. An entity presidency was derailed. \n\nThe Democratic Party succeeded in demonizing Russia, making them our primary enemy on the world stage, not the Chinese Communist Party, and bringing us to the verge of nuclear war in Eastern Europe as we conduct a proxy war in Ukraine. Not only that an entire three years of presidency was derailed, the country was pitted against itself. And everyone now has bought into lies and disinformation while pretending they're the warriors against disinformation... Not only were they not held accountable, they were so emboldened by this entire story, that they did the same thing again in 2020 with Hunter Biden's laptop.\"",

        "text": "I ask you, besides the defendant himself, who is at fault for this chain of events? Is it the bail commissioners who kept releasing him? No, because they had no way of knowing he was already on bail. Was it the judge who let him go on a mere $500.00 cash bail? No, she, too, had no way of knowing this offender was already out on bail for two crimes of violence.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe answer as to who is responsible is us. We, the legislature, are responsible. We are so busy focusing on who should be held for what crime, and who can release them, that we have never stopped to actually examine the mechanics of the system that we instruct the police, bail commissioners, and courts to operate within.\u00a0\n\nPassing a bill that says someone accused of committing x, y, or z offense can only be bailed by a judge does little good if the judge is not aware of all the facts. The judge will still decide bail based on the facts in front of them and still release people on bail, not knowing if they are already on bail from another part of the state.\u00a0\n\nBefore any bail reform bill can be effective, I believe we MUST fix this glaring loophole in our system. We are literally decades behind our neighboring states in technology that would interconnect the police departments so that they could inform the bail commissioners and courts that the person brought before them is on bail already, and is in violation of the terms of that bail.\u00a0\n\nI beg of you, please reconsider your decision to remove this funding, and start the process of fixing this, so that when we do present you with a good bipartisan bill in January, you, and the citizens of New Hampshire, can be sure that it will have the intended effect of keeping them safe from repeat violent offenders.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHon. Terry W. Roy\n\nNew Hampshire House of\u00a0\nRepresentatives Rockingham District 31\n\nChairman, Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee\u00a0\n#NHPolitics @KlandriganUL\n@AdamSextonWMUR\n\n2 of 2",

All humans are a potential danger to others.\n\nOur methods for evaluating risk are currently rather crude, both underinclusive and overinclusive.\n\nWe need better measures of risk. That is the same idea behind getting rid of cash bail.\n\nUnfortunately, some go too far. With the elimination of cash bail, we arguably have adopted a tendency to underincarcerate, which has in turn undermined the arguments against cash bail.\n\nIn both cases, there is a need to move from crude ancient systems without being pollyannish about it. That sounds simple, and it is in concept. But we have failed in implementation.\n\nToo many who do not pose a sufficient danger are incarcerated. And vice versa. The same logic that applies to jails applies here.",

        "text": "I have to say that the idea of ending cash bail is a complete disaster waiting to happen. It's a terrible idea that will only lead to more chaos and confusion in our justice system. Let me explain why.\n\nFirstly, cash bail is a crucial tool that helps ensure that defendants show up for their court dates. Without it, there will be no incentive for them to appear in court, and this will lead to a surge in the number of fugitives on the run. This will only make it harder for law enforcement to do their job and keep our communities safe.\n\nSecondly, ending cash bail will also lead to a significant increase in crime rates. Criminals will be more likely to commit crimes knowing that they won't have to pay bail to get out of jail. This will only embolden them and make our streets more dangerous.\n\nIn conclusion, ending cash bail is a terrible idea that will only lead to more problems than it solves. It will make our communities less safe, increase crime rates, and cost taxpayers billions of dollars. We need to keep cash bail in place to ensure that our justice system remains fair and effective.",

But a lot of the time those red states\u2019 crime problem is in their democrat controlled big/urban cities.\n\nDems passed the no cash bail BS and that\u2019s resulted in more crime. Think NYC. Because common sense says a guy who has 50 priors, he\u2019s going to commit more crime when he\u2019s booked and released without being held.\n\nAnd trying to defund police in the black majority cities? Yeah, let\u2019s take a city that\u2019s already crime filled, and then take away the only people that would stop the crime, because racism?\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI agree with Democrats that there needs to be police reform. Working in law-enforcement in the past I know for a fact there are lots of cops in this country that shouldn\u2019t be cops. But the only way to stop crime is more cops. Obviously.",

        "text": "If Bonds confuse you, read this (Bonds 101):\n\nGenerally, bond prices are inversely related to bond yields, however, the relationship is more complex when there is an inverted yield curve (where the yield on short-term bonds is higher than the yield on long-term bonds).\n\nBond prices can be higher or lower than their face value, depending on the demand for the bond:\n\n1) When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This is because investors can get a higher yield on new bonds, so they are willing to pay less for existing bonds.\n\n2) When interest rates fall, bond prices rise. This is because investors can get a lower yield on new bonds, so they are willing to pay more for existing bonds.\n\n3) HOWEVER, when there is an inverted yield curve, the relationship between bond yields and bond prices is more complex. This is because investors are not only looking at interest rates but also at the outlook for the economy. When investors are expecting a recession, they will be willing to pay more for bonds, even if interest rates are rising.\n\n\u2022 For short-term bonds, bond yields & bond prices follow their typical inverse relationship \n\n\u2022 For long-term bonds, the relationship is more complex because other factors like future economic expectations can influence demand, and therefore bond prices",

        "text": "I think the idea that issuing long term bonds has more impact  on assets than bills issuance is correct . But it has nothing to do with bank liquidity.  If a deposit is used to buy the bond (or bill for that matter if it doesn't deplete the RRP) the bank does indeed extinguish a reserve.  But the banking system isn't constrained by reserves as a whole.  Only a weak bank MAY have a constraint but, JPM Chase doesn't care about that.  A drop in reserves and deposits has no impact to their ability to extend credit.  However if long term bonds are issued instead  of bills, the buyer, either the bank or its client, does take on more risky assets which they may require Higher bond yields to do.  That will cause assets which use bond yields as a discount rate to also sell off.   For that reason bond issuance consumes more risk capital than bills and that is the impact linkage not the reserves reduction",

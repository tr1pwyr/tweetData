Why? Because the more socialist Americans are the more China can get us to conform to communism. Personally I believe China wants to take America. \n\nChina has been said to exist for over a 5000 years encompassing periods of great dynasties for over 1000 years several times over. \nJust because we are now a our great nation does not mean china is not nipping at our heels.\n\nRemember Rome was once the center of the greatest empire, extending all the way from Asia to the United Kingdom and Northern Africa from ~700BC to 476AD, or ~1000 years.",

That's for amateurs, folks. I crashed the economy! Top that!\" exclaimed the President in a speech on Thursday. \"That's what true leaders do. What is a Twitter?\"\n\nBiden then walked off the edge of the stage and fell to the ground, having mistaken air for stairs.\n\nExperts say the President is one of the foremost experts in wrecking things--including the economy, the military, the dollar, America's hopes and dreams, and his son Hunter.\u00a0\n\n\"DeSantis will have a ton of catching up to do if he wants to even approach the levels of ruin wrought upon the nation by President Biden,\" said one expert. \"When you look at how well Florida is doing, it would appear he may not be up for the job of further destroying the country.\"\nAt publishing time, DeSantis had responded forcefully to the criticism by crashing Disney's stock.",

Why won\u2019t Biden sign it?\n\nWhy is he deliberately and systematically killing the American economy?\n\nWhy is he dragging his heels after adding 10-15,000,000 new ILLEGAL DEPENDENTS and ANOTHER COUNTRY\u2019S DEFENSE to our rolls?\n\nWHY WON'T HE JUST MAKE THE DEAL WITH MCCARTHY BEFORE IT\u2019S TOO LATE?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you why:\n\nBECAUSE BIDEN IS A POS PRESIDENT WHO DOESN\u2019T CARE IF AMERICA FALLS.\n\nHe\u2019s told us that in everything he\u2019s done for the past 28 months, from killing our oil to opening the border to starting a war with Russia.\n\nAND NOW HE\u2019S BANKRUPTING US.\n\nAND NO ONE IS CALLING FOR IMPEACHMENT.\n\nWhich means the Republicans are making backdoor deals with Biden and his Democrats.\n\nI've said it a million times, and you're all as tired of hearing me say this as i am of saying it:\n\nBUT I CAN\u2019T AND WON'T STOP UNTIL BALANCE IS RESTORED TO OUR POLITICAL AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS!\n\nI\u2019m an Ameri-CAN. I\u2019m just made that way.\n\nGod Bless AMERICA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

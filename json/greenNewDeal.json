        "text": "Would the World be Better Off Without Cows?  An article written by Nancy Haugen, DVM and Montana Rancher, 2019. \n\nWould the world be better off without cows?  Advocates of the green new deal sound scholarly when they say so. They declare cow flatulence is really bad and is one of the things we should do away with to try and save the planet. I disagree.  \nAs a veterinarian I am familiar with the digestive systems of ruminants (cows and other species with rumens.) The rumen is a specialized fore stomach where cellulose from plants like grass (indigestible by mammals) is fermented by microorganisms into digestible carbohydrates and proteins.  A byproduct of that fermentation is gas which the ruminant burbs up. Some fermentation also occurs in the lower intestinal tract and gas from there is passed as flatulence.  Belching or farting who cares which end is comes from.  It's all bad, Right?  Cows are just one species of ruminants.  Others include sheep, goats, elk, deer, antelope, moose, caribou, bison, yak ... the list goes on and on.  Bison and cattle are so similar they can interbreed. Their feces and flatulence are indistinguishable one from the other.  Actually a large portion of the grazing animals on our planet are ruminants.  If belching and flatulence from these types of animal is destroying our environment shouldn't we get rid of them all? \nIn the early 1800's it is estimated there were more then 60 million bison on the great plains.  The USDA reports says in 2018 there were 9.4 million dairy cows and 31.7 million beef cows in the entire United States.  Was the environment worse when 60 million bison roamed the Great Plains? I think it was better then today.  In the 1800's people killed those bison, from 60 million to less then 600 animals.  Was the planet better off? Were there less green house gases? No. It was a terrible tragedy. How can people be so unwise? How can they be so ignorant of nature? Can you imagine the environmental devastation if all the ruminants were killed in the name of global warming? \nEven if you only killed the bovines (cow family) what a tragedy.  Cows are amazing creatures.  They convert grass into milk and meat.  Cattle have pulled plows, provided transportation, pulled wagons all while providing cheese and butter and meat and leather and organic fertilizer.  And all that has been powered by a solar generated renewable energy source, grass.\nI would like to coin a new word, boviphob, (people who hate or are afraid of cows.)It is as irrational, nonscientific ignorant and harmful as the other phobias.  I wish our politicians sought wisdom instead of talking points or mindless conformity to the latest societal whim.  Please, elected officials, whoever you may be,  research the issues.  Please support policies that are wise.  We are counting on you.  And please don't let cows be innocent victims.",

        "text": "As we celebrate Pride Month, it's important to remember that the fight for LGBTQ+ rights is far from over. There are still elected officials who want to deny members of our community their basic human rights. But what does it mean to be part of the LGBTQ+ community? For us, Pride is about fighting against tyranny, showing courage in the face of adversity, and spreading love to everyone, no matter who they love, what they look like, what they believe in, or where they come from. \n\nIf you're offended by any of this, I urge you to reconsider. The LGBTQ+ community isn't just a bunch of labels or names we get called. We're human beings, with hearts and souls that love who they love unconditionally. We're here to stay, and we won't let anyone take away our right to exist and live our lives authentically. Change is inevitable, but growth is optional. Let's all choose to grow a little more and open our hearts and minds to love and acceptance. Happy Pride Month! \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 #PrideMonth #LGBTQ+ #LoveIsLove #HumanRights",

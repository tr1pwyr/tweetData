That flag is the flag of cultural degradation. It is the flag of insidious malevolence, it is more sly than a serpent, it is more cunning than any predator. \n\nIt is a camouflage of warm colours, it speaks to children and says: nothing to fear, you are safe, this is the way, come and stand in the rainbow. The promise the Lord made with those colours, it speaks to you deep within. Kids cannot defend against such a camouflaged predator. \n\nIt is like the Revenge of the Sith: the Jedi order is akin to western peoples, in our peace, we have become ignorant and complacent\u2026 it is not a matter of when Order 66 shall be issued\u2026 Order 66 has already began, it has been ongoing for years. They have marched upon the temple, they marched into the schools, they marched in their colours of Pride, they marched into our Parliaments, the Senate, the judiciary, even our holy places -Churches. \n\nThey have marched, onwards, they are in our streets. This isn\u2019t a battle or a war\u2026 it is an occupation, and they marched into our Temple, they marched into all our institutions, and they did so without our blades being drawn, they did so within our rifles firing. \n\nWe have but one bastion. We have but one stronghold left. One family who stands in their way: The Royal Family of Britannia. Buckingham Palace is protected, under the most loyal of British. The Queen\u2019s death showed them, it showed them all that they managed occupation of the institutions and holy places, but they could not march into the sole bastion of our strength and might, of the British pride. \n\nRed is the colour of the sentinels of our last free bastion. It shall not fall, not without bloodshed, much bloodshed. \n\nThe return of the King showed them all, it showed the world, it showed Britannia that we have a rallying point, and when the King calls us forth, they shall realise that their occupation was a mistake, an occupation without bloodshed beforehand means one thing - you\u2019re surrounded, everyone and anything is a combatant, and they shall then comprehend that their occupation was their greatest undoing. \n\nThe Lion stirs from its long rest. I can see their fear, they know they will fall, they will not last.",

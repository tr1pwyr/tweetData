Yes, I am a libertarian who believes in \"live and let live.\"  I support gay marriage. I don't care about drag queens.  \n\nUnfortunately, the left no longer supports the live and let live philosophy.  They are demanding that we all participate in their delusion.  It's a religion that we must all profess belief in.  \n\nIt's not enough for us to accept someone else is personal life choices.  We must now use the pronouns that they have chosen. Unfortunately, far too many teachers have been fired for not complying with the demands of a spoiled narcissistic child demanding that the teacher call them by a ridiculous word the child made up yesterday.    \n\nUnfortunately, they are also changing science textbooks.  Teachers are no longer teaching actual science when it comes to sex and reproduction. Instead, they are now teaching extremist philosophies.   \n\nChildren are being encouraged to take sex hormone blockers without the consent of their parent. Many states have actually passed laws that allow schools to transition children without speaking to parents.  \n\nNow drag queens are entering schools. They have started off with reading hour but are now bringing children to drag queen events where they are dancing erotically.  \n\nSo no, I'm not going to just look the other way any longer.  If they have the right to do what they want, then why do we not have the right to do what we want?  Why do I need to participate in this delusion?\"",

        "text": "This \"They don't want LGBTQ people to exist\" and crying \"Genocide!\" is nothing but theatrical BS. Most ordinary Americans couldn't care less what you do. But it's not enough for you to coexist. You DEMAND that your kinky sex life be laid out there for all to see so you can be \"affirmed\" and \"celebrated.\" Instead of picking one of the countless rainbow churches to get married in, You DEMAND that the most conservative Christian churches change their doctrines for you in order to appease your every whim. (Weird, though, that you don't demand the same from Muslims.) \"Pride Parades\" are disgusting public displays of sex and perversion, something no straight person would be allowed to do (and very few would WANT to do). In the olden days, it was called \"indecent exposure\" and you could be arrested for it... but now you demand that we bring our little kids so they can see you run around in BDSM gear and wave your dildos too. Drag queens were fine with me as long as they were performing in nightclubs... but now they have to pole dance and read LGBTQ books in front of 3-year-olds. If you're a full-grown adult man who thinks he's a woman, I feel sorry for you, but if that's what you want... but you insist on pushing your mental illness on toddlers and on taking away the safe spaces and opportunities to succeed that women have worked so hard for. And if anyone doesn't like that, you scream \"Bigot\" and \"Homo/Transphobe.\" What the heck is wrong with you?",

Straight folks dont have entire campaigns or an entire month dedicated to celebrate and indoctrinate people into being straight. And they dont have to because its literally how human beings exist. If the lgbtq community would live their lives privately (as most people do) a vast majority of people who give them shit would stop. Everyone gets bullied one way or another, the main reason this community is bullied is because theyre so goddamn obnoxious about irrelevant characteristics like, who they fuck. Your sex life has othing to do with who you as a person, but pridfully touting your sex life as some moral foundation DOES show the world what kind of person you are--annoying.",

        "text": "The modern concepts of sexual orientation (1860), gender identities (1948), and lgbtq+ acronyms (1990s) are indeed relatively recent cultural inventions in human history. However, there is an increasing argument that they are wrongly presented as universal, timeless truths without sufficient consideration for the moral implications that contradict the beliefs held by the majority of the human population, as outlined in ancient religious texts such as Genesis 1:27 and Leviticus 18:22. These concepts have become incorporated into US law, leaving the majority of Americans who oppose them feeling defenseless and unable to disassociate without societal or legal repercussions.\n\nWhen examining the characteristics of lgbtq+ communities, it becomes evident that they encompass fundamental elements such as voluntary choice, belief systems, rituals, worship, community, ethics, moral values, symbols, and sacred teachings, which closely resemble religious practices. Thus, in the interest of justice and freedom for those who oppose these lifestyles and perceive them as morally objectionable, it is argued that the ideology surrounding gender and sexual orientation should be reclassified as a form of religion and removed from classifications of discrimination. This reclassification would place it on equal footing with other religions, resulting in a fairer and more neutral society. It would then exclude lgbtq+ representation from official public squares or workplaces through legislation that upholds the principle of separation of church and state. Such an approach would help maintain public squares, workplaces, and community guidelines as truly neutral and unbiased spaces that do not endorse or favor these modern concepts.",

It criminalized \"misgendering\".\n\nIn New York, if you refuse to use made-up pronouns like \"ze/zir\", that could get you fined $250,000 by the Commission on Human Rights.\n\nUse the wrong pronouns, and face fines. \n\n(Thankfully the State of California Third District Court of Appeals struck the California provisions down, but Weiner and people like him will keep trying. The New York law is still on the books.)",

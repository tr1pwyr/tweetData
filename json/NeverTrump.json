Breitbart even slammed him as \u201cAmnesty Don\u201d in 2018 and Trump ignored questions about his amnesty plans while at Davos, home of the WEF.\n\nA lot of Trump\u2019s attacks on DeSantis make sense when you accept he never stopped being a New York liberal who abandoned his hardline immigration platform as soon as he became president. \n\nSanctuary cities received discretionary funding that was in his power to withhold. The removal of illegal aliens from the interior of the US collapsed under Trump. His administration wanted to increase the number of EB-5 visas, which mostly go to Chinese investors, right before covid. Trump held a bizarre naturalization ceremony during the second night of the Republican National Convention in 2020. He\u2019s far weaker to attacks from the right on immigration than his campaign wants to admit.",

        "text": "Trump would never have filed personal BK because it would have meant his personal finances be disclosed, and after the fight he took to the Supreme Court, he wasn't exactly willing to share those details.\n\nAnd you're right, businesses file all the time, however, the question of would you want this man running your company is still valid. When you are leveraging BK as a means of CYA, while causing job losses and financial losses to partners, leveraging BK for a business to rebuild and try again, or BK protections to help a business transition through tough times - those are why the system is in place.\n\nTo file 6 times, from the same guy with 6 different businesses is more of an abuse of the system - albeit legal and albeit businesses do/can get away with it, it is still a very immoral and unethical way to do business.\n\nWhen you bundle in the lack of personal financial disclosure, BK multiple businesses and cost the American Tax Payers $144 million on golf outings (after blasting previous presidents for wasting tax payer money), the bigger picture issue here is the double standard and hypocrisy that exists. \n\nDo you think that because someone has the money to afford tax lawyers (because they clearly are not paying into the business), is a fair action over the average American small business owner who cannot get a loan to keep his business afloat?\n\nDo you think it is ok for PPP loans in the millions to be forgiven to persons worth 7 figures, meanwhile small business was crushed during COVID and qualifications were few and far between?\n\nDo you think that someone having money/power somehow gives them a pass to making decisions based off good morals and values? \n\nThe most obvious answer is no, right? So if the answer is no, and \"that's just the way it is\", do you trust someone who uses the system \"the way it is\", to make it better for the average American?",

Clinton never came near Trump's current level of support and only barely touched 50% in Gallup, which performed poorly in the primaries (NH was awful).\n\nBut more importantly, these are entirely different types of voters. The botched response to Ukraine w/ @TuckerCarlson was actually the beginning of DeSantis' decline. His handling of the indictment and subsequent missteps just reenforced an already present distrust.\n\nI'm skeptical the current strategy is sufficient to address that distrust and it's also more than a little ridiculous to compare how REP voters view DeSantis to how DEM voters viewed Obama.",

De Santis. It looks like Elon Musk is going to endorse De Santis, just recently Musk declared himself a Republican, before that he was anything but and more disturbingly the moderator of the interview (never thought you needed a moderator for a discussion), is none other than long time ally of Musk's who contributed 50K to Mitt Romney's campaign and we all know how he turned out but even more telling David Sacks, the \"moderator\" contributed 70K to the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\nIt should also be mentioned that DeSantis is long-time pals with the Bushs, not exactly a political dynasty that exudes \"Conservativism.\nMusk said we need a \"normal\" person in the White House, I couldn't disagree more because a \"normal\" person will be eaten alive by the Marxists DEMS who control their party and all their far-left agendas will continue and pass on debt to our children and their children that will be unstainable. \n\"Caveat emptor\", Ron DeSantis is not who he portrays himself to be\".",

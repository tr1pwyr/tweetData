First, change the crumby public elementary school reading curriculum. Listen to the podcast Sold a Story if you want to learn more. It\u2019s an outrage. I now understand my kids learned to read proficiently because my husband and I (and tutors for one child) taught them based on old school phonics. It wasn\u2019t the schools and their \u201cnew method.\u201d But not every parent has the time or background (or money) to do this. We need to demand that public schools adopt a science based reading curriculum \u2014 which includes phonics.",

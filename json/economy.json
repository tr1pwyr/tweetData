Idc what her race or gender is. \n\nShe was a true fiscal & effective conservative & saved NM\u2019s economy. She barred all state agencies from hiring former lobbyists. She rescinded sanctuary status for illegal immigrants who commit crimes in New Mexico. She put a cap on film tax credits; a bill that would exempt locomotive fuel from state gross-receipts tax; & an expansion of Katie's Law, which will require law-enforcement officials to obtain DNA samples from all suspects booked on felony charges. \n\nShe supported & signed a bill that will \"assign schools the grades of A to F based on student achievement & other factors, such as high-school graduation rates. She was the original fighter for education reforms.\n\nShe pushed for an increase in private investment to complete the US$212 million state-funded Spaceport America project. In order to drive the new effort, Gov. Martinez appointed an entirely new board of directors to oversee the Spaceport Authority. In 2012, Martinez sold the state's luxury jet, which she called \"the ultimate symbol of waste and excess\"; it sold for $2.51 million.\n\nDon\u2019t sleep on Susana. She\u2019s a fiscally responsible force.",

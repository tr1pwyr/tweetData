        "text": "It's possible there's some of that going on. But BLM was founded by Marxists. Weatherman terrorist & longtime Marxist organizer Eric Mann's decade-long protege Patrisse Cullors was elevated as one of three cofounders. BLM & other cofounders' RadLeft organizing projects have gotten a ton of money from oligarchs. Antifa rioters did much of their fundraising via CashApp & Venmo & may have received money from hostile foreign states. A number of US Marxist orgs are also connected to a domestic org with ties to the CCP. The whole thing is tough to sort out as far as respective parties' motives, intentions, & hopes. \n\nThose & other RadLeft orgs also seem to be easily nudged into violent/destructive action by Dem/media messaging. & there are Left orgs that seem to function as bridges between those groups & mainstream Dem organizing & have individual members/organizers who participate in both the Left & the RadLeft.\n\nThe CCP, Iran, Russia, others are also happy to contribute to chaos here to try to neutralize US geopolitical influence. And a bunch of oligarchs & UN types have an odd habit of praising & playing apologist for China. \n\nMy best read is we're being pushed into a fake technocratic neo-fascist global oligarchy, & a bunch of idealistic but also rage-filled RadLeftists & other lefties are being used as useful idiots for the project. But much is unclear from here in the cheap seats.",

Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers,\u201d she said, referring to BLM co-founder Alicia Garza.\n\n\u201cWe are trained Marxists.

I am thrilled to have been appointed by Colorado\u2019s Republican National Committeeman, Randy Corporon to serve on the Youth Advisory Council. It is an honor to be chosen to represent Colorado and my generation, Generation Z, on the national stage while working together to win in the 2024 elections across the country.\n\nColorado is on the front line of the fight to stop the radical left and Marxist takeover of our country and the next generations are the key to winning this war. In 2018 I addressed the Colorado Republican State Central Committee at the age of 15 and pleaded with them to take action to engage the youth and it appears that my call to action has finally been answered at the national level.\n\nI am looking forward to working with my fellow Young Republicans in this fight as we work to take back our country. Brilyn, C. J., myself, and the other Council members all bring our own unique talents and perspectives to this mission, and am sure that by working together we can come up with sound solutions and tactics to win this culture war and make up the ground we have lost to the Democrats in recent years.\n\nRead the full press release below:\nconta.cc/3MvyLMi\n@thecjpearson @BrilynHollyhand @GOP @GOPChairwoman @cologop @RepDaveWilliams @randycorporon",

Michael Whatley met with state party officials on Monday in Baton Rouge to plan the effort.\n\n\u201cGovernor John Bel Edwards and Democrats in the state of Louisiana vetoed attempts to improve election laws and created distrust in the election system. Democracy only works if every American has confidence in our election process. That is why we are here,\u201d said Michael Whatley, RNC General Counsel. \u201cLouisiana\u2019s upcoming elections are pivotal to the direction of our country, and we will be on the frontlines to protect the vote of every Louisianan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Democrats across our state continue to attack our election process, the LAGOP is working hand in hand with the RNC to secure our election integrity and create transparency,\u201d said Louis Gurvich, LAGOP Chairman. \u201cThis is a large-scale, sophisticated operation that will be conducted across the entire state. I appreciate the RNC for looking out for Louisiana and bringing integrity back to our ballot box.\u201d\n\n###\nlagop.com/post/republican-pa\u2026",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) needs to shut up and \u201cstep back.\u201d\n\nThe panel discussion was on Greene\u2019s motherhood questions to American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten during the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Select Coronavirus Crisis hearing Wednesday.\n\nSteele said, \u201cI watched the whole thing. I watched the dehumanization process, the degradation. But when you got to that part where she went after her as a mom, you questioned her motherhood, regardless of how she came into it, because women, and men, come into parenting in a whole lot of different ways. It just struck such a raw nerve for me, as an adopted child, to think that a Marjorie Taylor Greene could look at my mother and say she\u2019s not a mother? Well, you know, you need to shut the you know what up and step back because motherhood comes from the heart. It\u2019s something you do. It is an expression of love, discipline, all the things I said. For me, my party that sat here and railed for years about the value of the family, to watch this classless act, and these classless words being thrown at someone, because you disagree with them politically.\u201d",

From Wiki:  Debates took place among candidates in the campaign for the Republican Party's nomination for the president in the 2020 United States presidential election. The Republican National Committee (RNC) did not schedule any official RNC-sanctioned primary debates, and incumbent President Donald Trump stated that he would not debate any primary challenger. Thus, the debates held among Trump's primary challengers were instead sponsored by private organizations.",

She's a top GOP attorney, who spoke last week at a Republican National Committee retreat.  \n\nMitchell told Republicans at the retreat that they need to 'combat' efforts being made to get college kids to vote. She is mad that it's easy for college kids to vote.\n\n\u201cWe need to be looking at, what are these college campus locations and polling. What is this young-people effort that they do? They basically put the polling place next to the student dorms, so they just have to roll out of bed, vote, and go back to bed,\u201d she told them.\n\n\u201cWisconsin is a big problem because of the polling locations on college campuses. There are 501(c)(3)s. Their goal for the Supreme Court race was to turn out 240,000 college students in that Supreme Court race. And we don\u2019t have anything like that, and we need to figure out how to do that and combat that,\u201d she continued.\n\nNote that this is the same woman who took part in the January 2021 call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where Trump asked Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d 11,000 more votes for him in the state.",

        "text": "@GOPChairwoman\nBreaking News! Scam Alert  Hawaii GOP   \nEmail From: Honolulu County Steve Lipscomb \n\nAloha Honolulu County Patriots,\n\nToday we received a suspicious email at our OahuGOP info@oahugop.com email address, claiming to be from Republican National Committee (RNC) legal department. Attached to the email was a \u201cCease & Desist\u201d letter addressed to Past Chair Brett Kulbis.\n\nAs you know, scam emails are the preferred method for nefarious groups and individuals to gain access to our personal information or trick us into doing something bogus. Some of the easiest ways to expose these scams is by scrutinizing the contents.\n\nIn this case there are several inconsistencies about this email and attachment:\n\n   1.  The email was received today at 9:19 am, which is 3:19 pm in Washington DC where the RNC HQ is located. If this email was legit, it would have been sent earlier in the week so that inquiries could be made immediately and not wait over a weekend. This is a similar tactic email scammers often use.\n\n   2.  The cease and desist letter is addressed to past chair Kulbis; and the supporting document only shows the footer of our website, but if it was really legit the individual would have seen at the top of the website the County election announcement and the email would have been addressed to me.  Leadership of the Honolulu County Republican Party was formally transitioned to new officers at the official county convention several weeks ago, pursuant to state and county GOP rules.  Any serious attorney would have performed the needed due diligence and known this.  I\u2019ve reached out to \u201cMs. McGuire\u201d of the \u201cRNC\u201d to confirm or rebut the legitimacy of this email. I\u2019m still awaiting her response.\n\n   3.  The spoof email erroneously suggests that legitimately formed and duly elected county GOP organizations like ours have no legitimate rights for party branding and/or communication like thousands of county parties across the nation.  Hence, the spoof message assumes we will ignore the infinite number of legitimate Republican county party websites and social media accounts just like ours which have been in operation for years and years.  Obviously, a nefarious actor wishes to silence your county leadership team.\n\n   4.  It is widely known that the RNC does not get involved at the County levels unless a State Party has requested their assistance. I\u2019ve reached out to Chair Garcia to see if he knows about this. I\u2019m still awaiting his response.\n\n   5.  Neither the Kauai, Maui, East Hawaii, nor West Hawaii county party organizations have received a similar cease & desist letter.\n\n   6.  As mentioned above, nationally there are hundreds of counties that use \u201cGOP\u201d in their website and social media title and descriptions. Just looking at one state: California you have Sacramento GOP: \u201cSacCountyGOP\u201d Home Page - Sacramento County Republican Party (saccountygop.com); and Orange County: Republican Party of Orange County - Leadership (ocgop.org). I\u2019ve reached out to some other county parties and are awaiting their responses.\n\nWhile we continue to investigate this potential scam email, I wanted to make sure you\u2019re aware should you receive something similarly suspect and misleading. If you do, please forward it to me ASAP at steve.lipscomb@outlook.com.\n\nYour county leadership team is always on the lookout for spoofs and scams which seek to hijack our movement and undermine our mission. Please know that we will defend our party against those who seek to interfere with our organization, our messaging, our branding, and our determination to turn Hawai`i RED!\n\nAll the Best,\nSteve\n\n#RonnaMcDaniel",

I would encourage you to do more research beyond a few posts in the future before judging. You think someone who has worked at the Republican National Committee and for Republican Congressmen is super biased toward the left? His work has literally been used in political ads on both sides. Perhaps your own bias is causing the issue considering you saw CNN and had an immediate reaction without context. A five minute conversation with him, or an open minded one with me, would have disproved your theory, and I could give plenty of example as to why. He has been attacked by both Dems and Republicans before and after joining CNN, and I\u2019ve been there and seen it all. Again, fine moving forward, but maybe next time ask questions before assuming things. I\u2019m over it, I\u2019m not trying to pick a fight, and moving on. I don\u2019t even want to get into it because your reaction isn\u2019t uncommon (and frankly it gets exhausting), but just know you\u2019re very off base with your reactive assumptions. People aren\u2019t one dimensional monoliths based on their employers, and I\u2019m proud as hell of him and the work he has done - on multiple sides of the political spectrum.",

I have known Oscar for many years. We are always on opposite sides when it comes to politics but on this he and I agree. This is devastating to the GOP. Not only in Tennessee but around the country. Everyone sees the blatant racism that permeates the GOP. And recognizes they have lost any hope of getting black and young GenX votes for a decade after their actions.",

I'm just guessing but looking at the party as a whole I would say it is way more.\n\nBut hey... don't let me get in the way of the lefts lies and misinformation.

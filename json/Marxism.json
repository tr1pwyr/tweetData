The departments for humanities have been struggling for years to get students, they probably just dumbed it down to get more students. She can't tell the difference between a primary and secondary source and call herself a historian, that's not necessarily an issue of ideology but either education or intelligence (that's not to say she could be lying on purpose). Also i think the governments wants their numbers to look better, so more students graduating makes it look like they're helping education improve when on reality they just lower the standards and have more people pass because of it. Not necessarily a deliberate attempt to dumb things down but a result from people in gov trying to say they improved society and taking the easier path to manipulate numbers.",

They believe the world must be made free of differences, by any means necessary. That is why they are deleting sex-based rights. There aren't supposed to be any differences. \nIt's Marxist Theology.\n\nIf feminist women and men keep fighting to keep feminism alive, that means postmodernism will stay alive, which is the oxygen of Marxism, and by extension, Queer Theory.\n\nFeminists don't want to kill off that part of their identity, the belief that reality is subjective, and so Queer Theory will be kept alive.\n\nWe MUST return to sanity in modernism, where objective truths are allowed.\n\nFeminism won't win up against Queer Theory.\nQueer Theory is a stronger mind virus.\n\n...

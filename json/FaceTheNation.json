This statement may come as a shock, but it's time to face it.\n\n\"...we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge...would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\"  John Adams, US 2nd President.\n\nJohn Adams's use of the word \"religion\" was highly contextualized. He specifically meant the Protestant Christian religion, not religions in the generic or multicultural sense. Colonial America was a collection of various states each with a Christian denominational preference.",

However as a Head of State image matters; you are a metaphor for the state of the nation you represent and embody. \n\nThe FDR example you use is valid, but he projected strength and defiance in the face of adversity. Apt for a time when America faced economic Depression and War. Perhaps the perfect symbol for that moment. Whereas Biden and his obvious senility projects confusion, inaction and decline.\n\nMany will draw a parallel between this and America\u2019s decline. Perhaps rightly so.",

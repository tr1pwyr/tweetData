Apparently they want to lose all of their viewers unless you are Republican. CNN wants to FAFO one more time. This time with Mike Pence. The biggest problem CNN will have is getting a room full of Republicans that would ever vote for Trump's sworn enemy Pence. But they are going to try. After losing over half of their regular viewers last time. CNN is doubling down as the home of the Republican Party. Maybe they will lose half of their audience again. Pretty soon they will give Mike 'Pillow' Lindell his own show about election interference. Until CEO Chris Lich leaves CNN. They will continue  their move towards the right wing. Will MTG get a prime time show soon? How about Alex Jones? I know. CNN Primetime Nazi hour with Nick Fuentes. That should help get the Pro- Insurrection/ Pro Coup viewers CNN wants so much. What a sad situation. CNN used to be something great. Now they are simply pandering to the worse of America. #NoMoreCNN #DemVoice1",

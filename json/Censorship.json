        "text": "Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that encompasses the freedom to express one's thoughts, ideas, opinions, and beliefs without fear of censorship, retaliation, or persecution. It is recognized as a fundamental principle in many democratic societies and is protected by international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nFreedom of expression includes various forms of communication, such as spoken or written words, artistic expression, journalism, symbolic actions, and online communication. It not only protects popular or widely accepted opinions but also extends to unpopular or dissenting viewpoints, as it is essential for fostering a pluralistic society and promoting open debate and discussion.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that freedom of expression is not an absolute right and can be subject to certain limitations. These limitations are typically aimed at safeguarding public safety, national security, public order, public health, or protecting the rights and reputations of others. The exact scope and nature of these limitations can vary between countries and legal systems.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to distinguish between freedom of expression and actions that incite violence, hate speech, or defamation. While freedom of expression protects the right to express one's ideas and opinions, it does not protect expressions that directly cause harm to others or infringe upon their rights.\n\nOverall, freedom of expression is a vital pillar of democracy, enabling individuals to participate in public discourse, challenge established norms, contribute to social progress, and hold those in power accountable. It is a cornerstone of a free and open society, promoting diversity, tolerance, and the free flow of ideas.\n\n#FreedomChallenge \u2604",

        "text": "The left wants to be able to say whatever they like and not be challenged. That is why they support censorship. It' not hard to recognize truly threatening or hateful speech. But anyone who watches the actual tweets quickly realizes that the ones who are most often doxing or  talking about finding / killing / harming / someone or their loved ones are leftists.\n\nI have never, ever, seen a person on the right wish a person's children would be raped or murdered. I see the left say such things regularly. I have told people that they might see things differently if their child was raped or murdered, but that's very different from wishing it to happen.\n\nI have been a discussion forum moderator. I have seen all varieties of behavior. It's not that hard to recognize truly aggressive & threatening or hateful speech. The problem comes when you let your own views / emotions make the decision instead of reasoning.\n\nI have quite literally seen leftists allowed to threaten someone and their family without repercussions, but when the victim told the aggressor \"If you come near me or mine I will shoot you\"\u2014the victim got banned.",

        "text": "Following the @Telegraph news story today on censorship, the attached photos are the list of my articles, tweets and comments flagged by the Counter Disinformation Unit as potential \u2018disinformation\u2019.\n\nIt starts in 2020, continues throughout 2021 and into 2022 and even 2023, and covers topics that were ostensibly controversial (eg, questioning the vaccine roll-out to kids) and those that should have been incontrovertible (eg, \"let children use playgrounds, MPs demand\").\n\nWe don\u2019t know definitively how much of this translated to censorship, but like many critics of the Government\u2019s pandemic \u2018truths\u2019 \u2014 lockdowns, school closures, masking children, vaccinating healthy children \u2014 I had a recurring sense that my social media accounts were being hobbled or suppressed in some way.  The @UsforThemUK social media accounts received repeated warnings that the group would drop down in terms of priority on newsfeeds if we didn\u2019t remove content flagged by Meta as 'disinformation'.  For many individuals, accounts were expressly suspended or shut down.\n\nCircumstantially, then, it\u2019s not unreasonable to wonder whether monitoring at times traversed into censorship.\n\nI feel vindicated in my suspicions if also saddened by the arrogant authoritarian overreach. But the most serious implication of all this is that for an extended period, one narrative has been amplified and another subdued.  Many of the positions that I and others targeted by the CDU had advocated would, I believe, not only have been viewed as reasonable positions to take pre-2020, but to argue against them would have been considered extreme.\n\nIf you doubt that is true then consider how society would have judged anyone in 2019 who advocated mandatory isolation of children for weeks at a time; masking of children for 8 hours a day including through lessons to \u2018mitigate\u2019 against a virus which never seriously threatened them; injection of children with novel products despite no long term safety data existing.  None of these were moderate policy decisions. They only became legitimised and normalised because dissenting voices were systematically suppressed.\n\nGiven that the information now being flushed into the public domain stems from only a small number of individuals who have submitted subject access requests, we should assume that today's examples, and those previously detailed in the @BigBrotherWatch report, are the tip of a larger iceberg.  Adding to the work of the Government\u2019s spy units were fact checkers and \u2018trusted news\u2019 initiatives which further skewed discourse, and of course the outright shaming and smearing of those of us who argued against what we saw as the descent into a dangerously illiberal and unethical regime.\n\nThe reality of 2020-22 is that we were living through a period of State-sponsored extremism to which virtually no challenge in the public square was permitted. It hardly needs pointing out that this is at extreme odds with the notion of liberal democracy with which we tend to associate much of the developed West.  All of this could be examined by the Covid Inquiry, but of course today's revelations also make it less likely that a meaningful, successful, public inquiry is now possible.",

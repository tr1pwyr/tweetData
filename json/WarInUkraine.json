Now, Blinken is pushing America deeper into the war with #Russia knowing well Ukraine will never win. Russia will not also win. These wars are never won. But Ukraine will likely suffer more immediate and long term damages.\n\nAt international events, Blinken sounds great, gives speeches that attract ovation. But if a nuclear war explodes leading to a World War Three, killing millions of people, Blinken is likely to be remembered as the most disastrous Secretary of State in modern American history.\n\n In his speech days ago, he claimed that now is not the time for a cease-fire as that would allow Russia to re-arm. Even Napoleon Bonaparte, who is considered the greatest General who ever lived, lost the war against Russia more than 200 years ago. The only solution is sincere negotiations on all sides and not more wars and more money for wars that only enrich the military industrial complex and impoverish the common man. May God help us.",

        "text": "[Good analysis]\n\"There was the time last winter when President Biden was awakened at 3 a.m. while on a trip to Asia and told that a missile had struck Poland, touching off a panic that Russia might have expanded the war in Ukraine to a NATO ally. Within hours in the middle of the night, Mr. Biden consulted his top advisers, called the president of Poland and the NATO secretary general, and gathered fellow world leaders to deal with the crisis.\nAnd then there was the time a few weeks ago when the president was hosting children for Take Your Child to Work Day and became mixed up as he tried to list his grandchildren. \u201cSo, let me see. I got one in New York, two in Philadelphia \u2014 or is it three? No, three, because I got one granddaughter who is \u2014 I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re confusing me.\u201d He also drew a blank when asked the last country he had visited and the name of a favorite movie.\nThe two Joe Bidens coexist in the same octogenarian president: Sharp and wise at critical moments, the product of decades of seasoning, able to rise to the occasion even in the dead of night to confront a dangerous world. Yet a little slower, a little softer, a little harder of hearing, a little more tentative in his walk, a little more prone to occasional lapses of memory in ways that feel familiar to anyone who has reached their ninth decade or has a parent who has.\nThe complicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president was encapsulated on Thursday as Congress approved a bipartisan deal he brokered to avoid a national default. Even Speaker Kevin McCarthy testified that Mr. Biden had been \u201cvery professional, very smart, very tough\u201d during their talks. Yet just before the voting got underway, Mr. Biden tripped over a sandbag at the Air Force Academy commencement, plunging to the ground. The video went viral, his supporters cringed and his critics pounced...\nThe question of Mr. Biden\u2019s age does not come in isolation, of course. Mr. Trump, his likeliest Republican challenger, is just four years younger and was the oldest president in history until Mr. Biden succeeded him. If Mr. Trump were to win next year, he would be 82 at the end of his term, older than Mr. Biden will be at the end of this one.\nWhile in office, Mr. Trump generated concerns about his mental acuity and physical condition. He did not exercise, his diet leaned heavily on cheeseburgers and steak and he officially tipped the scales at 244 pounds, a weight formally deemed obese for his height.\nAfter complaining that he was overscheduled with morning meetings, Mr. Trump stopped showing up at the Oval Office until 11 or 11:30 a.m. each day, staying in the residence to watch television, make phone calls or send out incendiary tweets. During an appearance at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he had trouble lifting a glass of water and seemed to have trouble making his way down a modest ramp. nytimes.com/2023/06/04/us/po\u2026 #cdnpoli",

        "text": "Donald Trump didn\u2019t launch a new all-out ground invasion on the scale of Iraq. He did, however, massively escalate conflict in every theatre of war he inherited, repeatedly brought the country to the brink of new wars, and recklessly threw around U.S. power with no regard for the many lives it would cost. The 'anti-war' candidate, like those before him, was a pro-war president.\n\nDespite repeated PR stunts, Trump did not 'bring the troops home' or 'end endless wars.' In fact, Trump consistently added fuel to the fire, increasing troop levels, deepening reliance on private contractors, and dramatically scaling up aerial warfare. Where an end to endless war requires repealing the 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force, Trump expanded conflicts under both. His term saw four consecutive years of growth of an already out-of-control Pentagon budget. And loosening even the minimal restrictions that were already in place, he expanded the United States\u2019 deadly and unaccountable drone wars.\n\nNot only did Trump not end the wars he promised to. He made them worse by dropping more bombs, stoking further conflict, undermining the prospects of peace, and massively increasing the rate of civilian deaths. U.S. support for the Saudi- and UAE-led intervention in the war in Yemen is one of the most egregious examples of destructive militarist foreign policymaking in years. Not only did Trump do nothing to end U.S. complicity himself, he repeatedly used his veto power to override bipartisan majorities in Congress that tried to stop U.S. military involvement and block the flow of arms to the conflict.",

He did, however, massively escalate conflict in every theatre of war he inherited, repeatedly brought the country to the brink of new wars, and recklessly threw around U.S. power with no regard for the many lives it would cost. The 'anti-war' candidate, like those before him, was a pro-war president.\n\nDespite repeated PR stunts, Trump did not 'bring the troops home' or 'end endless wars.' In fact, Trump consistently added fuel to the fire, increasing troop levels, deepening reliance on private contractors, and dramatically scaling up aerial warfare. Where an end to endless war requires repealing the 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force, Trump expanded conflicts under both. His term saw four consecutive years of growth of an already out-of-control Pentagon budget. And loosening even the minimal restrictions that were already in place, he expanded the United States\u2019 deadly and unaccountable drone wars.\n\nNot only did Trump not end the wars he promised to. He made them worse by dropping more bombs, stoking further conflict, undermining the prospects of peace, and massively increasing the rate of civilian deaths. U.S. support for the Saudi- and UAE-led intervention in the war in Yemen is one of the most egregious examples of destructive militarist foreign policymaking in years. Not only did Trump do nothing to end U.S. complicity himself, he repeatedly used his veto power to override bipartisan majorities in Congress that tried to stop U.S. military involvement and block the flow of arms to the conflict.",

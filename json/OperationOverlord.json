Eisenhower wrote these words to the troops before the D-Day invasion: \u201cThe eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. \u2026 Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped, and battle-hardened. \u2026The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

        "text": "Crash Course: D-Day @ 79.\n\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\n\nJune 6, 1944, Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower gives the go-ahead for the largest amphibious military operation in history: Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of northern France, commonly known as D-Day.\n\nBy daybreak, 18,000 British and American parachutists were already on the ground. An additional 13,000 aircraft were mobilized to provide air cover and support for the invasion. At 6:30 a.m., American troops came ashore at Utah and Omaha beaches. \n\nThe British and Canadians overcame light opposition to capture Gold, Juno and Sword beaches; so did the Americans at Utah. The task was much tougher at Omaha beach, however, where the U.S. First Division battled high seas, mist, mines, burning vehicles\u2014and German coastal batteries, including an elite infantry division, which spewed heavy fire. Many wounded Americans ultimately drowned in the high tide. British divisions, which landed at Gold, Juno, and Sword beaches, and Canadian troops also met with heavy German fire.\n\nBut by day\u2019s end, 155,000 Allied troops\u2013Americans, British and Canadians\u2013had successfully stormed Normandy\u2019s beaches and were then able to push inland. Within three months, the northern part of France would be freed and the invasion force would be preparing to enter Germany, where they would meet up with Soviet forces moving in from the east.\n\nBefore the Allied assault, Hitler\u2019s armies had been in control of most of mainland Europe and the Allies knew that a successful invasion of the continent was central to winning the war. Hitler knew this too, and was expecting an assault on northwestern Europe in the spring of 1944. He hoped to repel the Allies from the coast with a strong counterattack that would delay future invasion attempts, giving him time to throw the majority of his forces into defeating the Soviet Union in the east. Once that was accomplished, he believed an all-out victory would soon be his.\n\nFor their part, the Germans suffered from confusion in the ranks and the absence of celebrated commander Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who was away on leave. At first, Hitler, believing that the invasion was a feint designed to distract the Germans from a coming attack north of the Seine River, refused to release nearby divisions to join the counterattack and reinforcements had to be called from further afield, causing delays.\n\nHe also hesitated in calling for armored divisions to help in the defense. In addition, the Germans were hampered by effective Allied air support, which took out many key bridges and forced the Germans to take long detours, as well as efficient Allied naval support, which helped protect advancing Allied troops.\n\nThough D-Day did not go off exactly as planned, as later claimed by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery\u2013for example, the Allies were able to land only fractions of the supplies and vehicles they had intended in France\u2013the invasion was a decided success. By the end of June, the Allies had 850,000 men and 150,000 vehicles in Normandy and were poised to continue their march across Europe.\n\nThe heroism and bravery displayed by troops from the Allied countries on D-Day has served as inspiration for several films, most famously The Longest Day (1962) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). It was also depicted in the HBO series Band of Brothers (2001).\n\nMacDuff",

The amphibious assault, codenamed Operation Overlord, landed about 156,000 Allied soldiers on the beaches of Normandy by the end of the day.0 The Normandy landings, also known as D-Day, were the largest seaborne invasion in history and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front. Within a few days, about 326,000 troops, more than 50,000 vehicles, and some 100,000 tons of equipment had landed. By August 1944, all of northern France had been liberated, and in spring 1945, the Allies had defeated the Germans.",

        "text": "Operation Overlord, commonly known as D-Day Invasion, was the Allied invasion of Normandy - June 6, 1944. The largest seaborne invasion in history, and the beginning of the end of World War II in Europe. #DDay\n\nLed by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Allied forces landed on five beaches along the Normandy coast: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. The landings were preceded by a massive air and naval bombardment, but the Germans were still well-prepared, and the Allies faced heavy resistance. #Normandy\n\nThe American forces at Omaha Beach faced the fiercest fighting. The beach was heavily defended by German machine guns and artillery, resulting in heavy casualties for Americans pushing through the breach point. However, they eventually secured the beachhead. #LiberationOfFrance\n\nBritish and Canadian forces were more successful at the other beaches. They were able to land quickly and suffered the least casualties. By the end of the day, Allied forces had established a foothold in Normandy, and the liberation of France had begun. #BeachHeadSecured\n\nD-Day was a costly and bloody battle, but it was a necessary step in the liberation of France and the eventual victory of the Allies in World War II. The courage and sacrifice of the Allied troops on D-Day will never be forgotten.\n\nThose who fought in this battle was a part of the greatest generation of Americans to ever serve in our nations armed forces and their sacrifices ended a World War. #Heroes\n#TruBlue #DemVoice1 #ONEV1 Z24 #DemCastFL #ProudBlue #VetsResist",

        "text": "On June 6, 1944, a U.S. Coast Guard landing craft dubbed LCIL-88 hovered a mile or so off Omaha Beach ahead of Operation Overlord during #WWII. On board was A. J. Liebling, scion of a wealthy New York family and famed writer at the New Yorker. Liebling was one of the first journalists to witness the carnage of #DDay, which is still the largest amphibious landing in military history.\n\n\"D-Day\u2019s beauty and pathos is distilled into what Liebling glimpsed that morning from his aerie on LCIL-88. After the boat sped back up, it soon encountered capsized vessels, a burning LCT (Landing Craft, Tank), and infantrymen floating in bloodied water, many with heads submerged. Other G.I.\u2019s were struggling in water up to their necks. Fourteen years later Liebling was to write of the men in the water off Easy Red: 'They seemed as permanently fixed in time and space as those Marines in the statue of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima.'\n\nTracer bullets, each with a descending arc, were zinging all around as Rigg swung LCIL-88 to the right. With machine gun bullets battering the boat, Liebling found himself shoulder-to-shoulder with a pharmacist\u2019s mate. The two flattened their backs against the pilot house and sucked in their guts. Artillery explosions were ripping into the water; it felt like at any second the boat would founder. Noxious smoke was everywhere; the noise was deafening.\n\nMoments later Liebling felt the craft run aground. He craned his neck toward the bow and saw that the landing ramp was somehow, miraculously, already down; his pal, the coxswain, clad only in bathing trunks and a helmet, had leapt into the surf. In spite of the pandemonium, the Navy men were rushing forward, rifles and demolition equipment in hand.\n\nLiebling could hear an officer, probably Carusi, chanting, 'Move along now! Move along!,' as if, Liebling wrote, 'he were unloading an excursion boat at Coney Island. But the men needed no urging; they were moving without a sign of flinching.' Much of the enemy firing, Liebling surmised, seemed to be coming from the blockhouse on the right that Rigg had singled out.\n\nSomething scratched at the back of Liebling\u2019s neck. Fearing the worst, he grabbed at it, and discovered that the ship\u2019s cargo rigging, knocked loose by machine gun fire, had fallen around his shoulders 'like a character in an old slapstick movie about a spaghetti factory.'\n\nAs Liebling rid himself of the rope, he glanced toward the stern. There he took in 'a tableau that was like a recruiting poster.' Three enlisted men, one of them a black wardroom steward, were manning a 20-millimeter rapid-firing gun. Fluttering behind them was a crisp American flag that Rigg had broken out for the occasion.\"\n\nRead more about Liebling's experience on D-Day here: americanheritage.com/aj-lieb\u2026\n\nPhoto: Liebling, in khaki pants with his back to the camera, onboard LCIL-88 steaming to Normandy.

The operation combined military units from five countries, led by General Dwight D Eisenhower. Code names were assigned to individual operations that made up the larger plan, and included Gold, Juno, Sword, Utah, Omaha and Pointe du Hoc beach landings, Airborne drops at night behind enemy lines, Pegasus Bridge capture, Merville gun battery attack, and later, operations Cobra and Bluecoat. A large amount of preparation had gone into planning logistics, transportation, weather forecasting, intelligence gathering and training. The invasion would last until August with heavy casualties suffered on all sides. Ultimately the objective was achieved opening up the Western Front against Germany and speeding the victory over Nazi forces in Europe less than a year later.",

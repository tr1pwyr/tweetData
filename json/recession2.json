        "text": "Gross domestic income, a measure of total economic activity, shrank in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Two negative quarters of output growth are one indicator of a recession.\n\nLabor productivity fell 2.1% in the first quarter from the fourth at an annual rate, and was down 0.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the Labor Department said. That is the fifth-straight quarter of negative year-over-year productivity growth\u2014the longest such run since records began in 1948\n\n\u201cOver the past two quarters, real GDP shows the economy expanding by 1.0%, not far off potential growth, whereas GDI shows it contracting by 1.4%, which amounts to a decent-sized recession,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.\n\nThe second quarter is also shaping up to be weak. S&P Global Market Intelligence sees second-quarter real GDP expanding at a 0.8% annual rate; Morgan Stanley projects 0.3%. The Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model estimates 2%.\n\nGDI measures incomes earned in wages and profits, while GDP tallies up purchases of goods and services produced.",

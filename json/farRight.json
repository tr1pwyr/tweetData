The loan was taken from a Czech-Russian bank for ‚Ç¨9.4 million.\n\nTrips to Crimea were also made by Le Pen and members of her party, as well as some members of the right-wing party Les R√©publicains. On this occasion, they declared that they considered Crimea Russian. Furthermore, referendums or elections in Russia were described as ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù by party officials sent there as observers.\n\nWhen President Vladimir Putin received her in April of the same year, she declared before the Duma that she wished to have the international sanctions against Russia lifted.\n\nNow, not  Zelensky, but Le Pen is a criminal...no words just no words.\n#France #Ukraine",

But, they will never support the extremely hateful far-right MAGA movement who's so intolerant they attack their own center the moderate Republicants calling them RINOs. The far left can go too far on the rhetoric the far right is actively trying to destroy this republic, its institutions, and the constitution to make us at best an authoritarian government at worst a totalitarian one. J6 was a CW v2.0 salvo if the fires üî• of misinformation and hateful demonization of fellow citizens continue to be stoked I fear this republic will destroy itself from within, this great experiment will have failed because of lust for power and greed at the highest levels.

No laws have been passed infringing upon your right to bear arms, your right to marry, your right to NOT have an abortion if you don‚Äôt want one, you‚Äôre right to NOT go see a drag show if you don‚Äôt want to, and the list goes on. But the people on the left are having rights stripped away daily, via legislation from right wing extremist governors and legislatures across the country. I guess you‚Äôre OK with all of that.

  "text": "What do we Albertans have to be distressed about B? \n\nThe sun has poked through the smoke from the nearby hellscape. \n\nOur current Premier was conspiring with a far right preacher convicted of inciting violence against the RCMP. \n\nWhich we won‚Äôt have to worry about for long, because as soon as Danielle Smith is elected, they can wrap up their whip sharp investigation into Jason Kenney‚Äôs cheating last election and pack their things. \n\nThe new Alberta Police Force will be made of only manly men. \n\nMen unconstrained by law to do what‚Äôs right by Danielle. \n\nThere will be many riots to quell. \n\nThe obvious ones. \n\nClearcutting the Legislature grounds for better field of fire from the new gun emplacements\n\nClearcutting the eastern slopes for easier access to dark, delicious coal. \n\nAdopting pieces of coal as legal Alberta currency and using it to pay healthcare workers and Alberta pensions. \n\nCharging a $5,000 hospital exit fee. \n\nBanning abortions, homosexuals, deviants and the promiscuous outside of the care and attention of an ordained minister. \n\nReplacing Doctors with Licensed Practical Nurses, then replacing them with homeopathy. No more fault free cancers. \n\nOur CPP will go UCP\n\nOur GDP will go MIA\n\nAverage IQ: Q anon\n\nThat meme of you eating ketchup chips in your window? \n\nAmerica - Alberta, potato - potato. \n\n(I don‚Äôt know how you professional comedians make that joke work so much better than me.)",

  "text": "\"Right-wing alt-tech platforms may attract investors and a flood of indignant new users with persecution complexes, but they are, ultimately, bad businesses. That‚Äôs precisely because they lack the one thing that fuels far-right discourse: a way to own the libs. A culture war is no fun if there‚Äôs no actual conflict, and although some journalists and pundit diehards remain, many of Twitter‚Äôs prolific users are posting less and on different platforms. Social-media platforms that cater to the right‚Äôs ideology eventually become tired and predictable‚Äîthe result of the same loud people shaking their fist at digital clouds. History has shown us that there are plenty of ways a social network can die, but the quickest way is boredom.\"",

  "text": "Nice try, comrade. There are indeed some countering perspetives regarding the presence of far-right and neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine. It's important to note that this is a complex and contentious topic, and different sources may present varying viewpoints. Some of the countering perspectives include:\n\nKremlin Propaganda: Critics argue that the portrayal of Ukraine as overrun by neo-Nazis is part of Kremlin propaganda aimed at discrediting and destabilizing the country. They suggest that Russia seeks to undermine Ukraine's image internationally by exaggerating the influence of far-right groups.\n\nInfluence Exaggeration: Some argue that while there may be far-right and nationalist elements within Ukraine's political spectrum, their influence and representation are often exaggerated. They contend that these groups have limited political power and support, and they do not represent the majority of Ukrainians.\n\nContext of Conflict: Supporters of Ukraine argue that the focus on far-right groups often overlooks the broader context of the country's conflict with Russia. They suggest that during times of conflict, extreme nationalist sentiments may gain attention, but they do not reflect the overall values or aspirations of the Ukrainian people.\n\nMarginalized and Diverse Society: Proponents of a more nuanced perspective emphasize that Ukraine is a diverse society with a range of political ideologies. They assert that while there may be some extremist elements, Ukraine also has vibrant civil society, human rights organizations, and pro-European democratic movements that promote inclusivity and tolerance.\n\nIt's crucial to critically evaluate different perspectives, consider the credibility and biases of sources, and engage with a variety of viewpoints to form a well-rounded understanding of the issue.",

  "text": "Cute. \n\nWhite supremacist groups have garnered increased attention and visibility in recent years, largely due to the rise of far-right extremism and the proliferation of online platforms. While it is difficult to measure the exact strength or size of these groups, there have been concerning indications of their growing influence.\n\nSome white supremacist groups have utilized social media platforms and online forums to recruit new members, spread propaganda, and coordinate activities. Their ability to connect with like-minded individuals globally has amplified their reach and potential impact. Additionally, instances of hate crimes, acts of violence, and public demonstrations associated with white supremacist ideologies have raised concerns about the growth of these movements.\n\nIt is important to address the underlying factors that contribute to the appeal of such groups, such as economic disparities, social divisions, political polarization, and the spread of misinformation. Countering white supremacy requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, community engagement, law enforcement efforts, and promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.\n\nEfforts are being made by various organizations, governments, and communities to combat the influence of white supremacist groups and promote tolerance and understanding. However, continued vigilance and collective action are necessary to address the underlying causes and prevent the further spread of extremist ideologies.",

The only issue right now is that without that rock in place the structure of the root system is pushing the seedling out of the soil. I've placed a little bit more soil underneath the rock and over the base of the tap root, and adjusted the rock a bit. Hopefully the root system gains a better hold of the soil soon. It may also have been the squirrels that loosened it up, but I'm not sure. For now it's behind my pool screen in a more protected area, but I moved it just to take the pictures.",

RACIST! RACIST! three times in every sentence you say or write.. Always start your lies with \"He's racist!\"without any proof or reason. Remember Democrat commies, Mao, Democrat Party, Stalin, and Hitler where successful because if you tell the lie long enough, the masses will believe. \n3) Call the Domestic terrorist hotline- DoJ, FBI, HLS, IRS, or Communist George Soros, Left wing CNN/MSNBC, or Biden Crime family for additional use of threats, show trials, planting of evidence or propaganda lies. The domestic terror groups are on the Democrat side and use tax payer money to pay people to continue the lie Example-Steele was paid 1.1 million to continue the Russia lie using tax payer funds or the Twitter censor receiving 3.6 million in cash for suppressing the Hunter Biden Story so Biden could win the election.\n4. Illegal voting in our next election- Democrats will win the 2024 election this time rigging it with illegals, algrothi.s, and Big Tech suppression. Usually shadow banning like what happens to me on a daily basis. They know Trump will not concede. I put nothing past our domestic terrorists who decide elections- including slander, show trials, and assassination.\n5. Green Deal communists! When posting about the environment- use fear and communist lies of boiling oceans children on fire, food shortages, and turning water into poison! Fear! Roll around on the ground in front of small children pretending to be on fire while screaming for mommy to save me from Republicans. This is best done at any communist Marxist district like LAUSD- or Culver City Unified Marxist schools.  The sky is falling and screaming in pain to small children. Remember- communist overthrow doesn't work if someone exposes the truth! We need to hide the truth and tell small children there is no hope or future- vote commie Democrat! \n5. Make sure that teacher's unions pushthe Democrat political agenda in public schools to innocent children: butt sex with farm animals, chemical castration without notification of parents, pedo Hollywood relations dating apps, Parents are domestic terrorists if they accuse the Marxist Democrat school district of promoting pedo dating, and lie about the Green new deal to children. Tell them their parents will die if you support Donald Trump. \n\nSincerely John Boy Walton 1%",

RACIST! RACIST! three times in every sentence you say or write.. Always start your lies with \"He's racist!\"without any proof or reason. Remember Democrat commies, Mao, Democrat Party, Stalin, and Hitler where successful because if you tell the lie long enough, the masses will believe. \n3) Call the Domestic terrorist hotline- DoJ, FBI, HLS, IRS, or Communist George Soros, Left wing CNN/MSNBC, or Biden Crime family for additional use of threats, show trials, planting of evidence or propaganda lies. The domestic terror groups are on the Democrat side and use tax payer money to pay people to continue the lie Example-Steele was paid 1.1 million to continue the Russia lie using tax payer funds or the Twitter censor receiving 3.6 million in cash for suppressing the Hunter Biden Story so Biden could win the election.\n4. Illegal voting in our next election- Democrats will win the 2024 election this time rigging it with illegals, algrothi.s, and Big Tech suppression. Usually shadow banning like what happens to me on a daily basis. They know Trump will not concede. I put nothing past our domestic terrorists who decide elections- including slander, show trials, and assassination.\n5. Green Deal communists! When posting about the environment- use fear and communist lies of boiling oceans children on fire, food shortages, and turning water into poison! Fear! Roll around on the ground in front of small children pretending to be on fire while screaming for mommy to save me from Republicans. This is best done at any communist Marxist district like LAUSD- or Culver City Unified Marxist schools.  The sky is falling and screaming in pain to small children. Remember- communist overthrow doesn't work if someone exposes the truth! We need to hide the truth and tell small children there is no hope or future- vote commie Democrat! \n5. Make sure that teacher's unions pushthe Democrat political agenda in public schools to innocent children: butt sex with farm animals, chemical castration without notification of parents, pedo Hollywood relations dating apps, Parents are domestic terrorists if they accuse the Marxist Democrat school district of promoting pedo dating, and lie about the Green new deal to children. Tell them their parents will die if you support Donald Trump. \n\nSincerely John Boy Walton 1%",

Commie Democrat/ Fascist/ Socialist / Big Tech FBI  paid censors  checklist before posting:\n\n1) Check with Communist George Soros, Communist China, Domestic Federal Terrorists FBI, CIA,FCC and HLS before posting your communist propaganda.\n2) Always start with slanderous lies and misrepresentations of Trump or any white males as RACIST! RACIST! RACIST! three times in every sentence you say or write.. Always start your lies with \"He's racist!\"without any proof or reason. Remember Democrat commies, Mao, Democrat Party, Stalin, and Hitler where successful because if you tell the lie long enough, the masses will believe. \n3) Call the Domestic terrorist hotline- DoJ, FBI, HLS, IRS, or Communist George Soros, Left wing CNN/MSNBC, or Biden Crime family for additional use of threats, show trials, planting of evidence or propaganda lies. The domestic terror groups are on the Democrat side and use tax payer money to pay people to continue the lie Example-Steele was paid 1.1 million to continue the Russia lie using tax payer funds or the Twitter censor receiving 3.6 million in cash for suppressing the Hunter Biden Story so Biden could win the election.\n4. Illegal voting in our next election- Democrats will win the 2024 election this time rigging it with illegals, algrothi.s, and Big Tech suppression. Usually shadow banning like what happens to me on a daily basis. They know Trump will not concede. I put nothing past our domestic terrorists who decide elections- including slander, show trials, and assassination.\n5. Green Deal communists! When posting about the environment- use fear and communist lies of boiling oceans children on fire, food shortages, and turning water into poison! Fear! Roll around on the ground in front of small children pretending to be on fire while screaming for mommy to save me from Republicans. This is best done at any communist Marxist district like LAUSD- or Culver City Unified Marxist schools.  The sky is falling and screaming in pain to small children. Remember- communist overthrow doesn't work if someone exposes the truth! We need to hide the truth and tell small children there is no hope or future- vote commie Democrat! \n5. Make sure that teacher's unions pushthe Democrat political agenda in public schools to innocent children: butt sex with farm animals, chemical castration without notification of parents, pedo Hollywood relations dating apps, Parents are domestic terrorists if they accuse the Marxist Democrat school district of promoting pedo dating, and lie about the Green new deal to children. Tell them their parents will die if you support Donald Trump. \n\nSincerely John Boy Walton 1%",

He wasn\u2019t supposed to win. They padded votes for HRC & she still didn\u2019t win!\n\nThat\u2019s why they padded so hard for Joe that they had more votes than voters in some counties.  And with lightening speed, they told Joe to undo everything Trump did.  Closed pipeline & opened the border on DAY ONE.\n\nJoe is illegitimate & DJT deserves his second term.",

The flight of the upper echelon of Big Tech executives to London leaves behind the homeless, drug addicted and those with merely middle class means to struggle with high rents and even higher taxes, while living amidst high crime and many untreated mentally ill who cannot fend for themselves.  San Francisco is no longer a desirable vacation destination but rather a dirty, dismal place in which to live and work. This beautifully constructed city was once 'the Paris of North America' and now it has become a reflection of what seriously ill conceived public policy can do to any city, in any place and time. Gangsters practicing high tech graft, woke and non-woke cronyism and unending greed in the political classes has ended the SF that built great spans across the bay and brought refinement in music, art and natural landscapes preserved and architecture to every resident. \nOur Cities are the foundation of American wealth or they can drag our fellow citizens down into poverty of the soul as well as the body or raise up a nation which can be admired by all who aspire to a deeply good life, not merely one clogged with possessions and status symbols. In our Western Liberal democracy we can choose the better path, and we must in order to help the helpless who live on cold, dirty, mean streets in SF.",

        "text": "I just had a positive impact review for the last semester, and also survived the latest round of layoffs, so I should be pretty safe for the next 6 months at least. If other big tech companies continue to do layoffs, then my company may too. We never know.\n\nHowever, I was a very happy freelancer before Shopify contacted me, so if I ever get laid off, I will most likely go back to freelancing. And in my freelancing career, my leetcoding skills were never that useful. So I'm not how strategic it truly is for me to focus on these interviewing skills.\n\nI think the most strategic thing I could do right now for my career is to get a lot of great shit done in my current job.",

Racist! Racist! Racist! The Marxist communist Democrat should spew that line constantly to hide the real truth- communism is a complete failure to the masses by using and accusing the opposition fools the masses into communism- Mao/Stalin/Hitler/Democrat Party. Always start your lies with \"He's racist!\"without any proof or reason. \n3) Call the Domestic terrorist hotline- DoJ, FBI, HLS, IRS, or Communist George Soros, Left wing CNN/MSNBC, or Biden Crime family for additional use of threats, show trials, planting of evidence or propaganda lies. The domestic terror groups are on the Democrat side and use tax payer money to pay people to continue the lie-;Example-!Steele was paid 1.1 million to continue the Russia lie using tax payer funds or the Twitter censor receiving 3.6 million in cash for suppressing the Hunter Biden Story so Biden could win the election.\n4. Illegal voting in our next election- Democrats will win the 2024 election this time rigging it with illegals, algrothi.s, and Big Tech suppression. Usually shadow banning like what happens to me on a daily basis. They know Trump will not concede. I put nothing past our domestic terrorists who decide elections- including slander, show trials, and assassination.\n5. Tell the lie over and over and over until the communist Democrat fools believe.\n6) Blame shifting- Even when it's 100% Democrat policies that fail- Blame shift to Trump move to hide the facts that communist/socialist polices are complete failures.  \n7)!Always start you lie with Trump started this mess lie and babble on! Tell the lie long enough and stupid people will start nodding their heads in agreement. Look at Black Democrats! Democrats were the slave owners during the Civil War and they still control their minds with deception, lies and lousy public school education.\nSincerely John Boy Walton 1%",

Some lost their health. Some lost their lives.\u00a0 Excess mortality is sky-high.\n\nAfter three long years of lies, the Australian people deserve the truth.",

        "text": "Update: MS/ABK\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Activision Deal Has Split Regulators. That\u2019s Bad News for Big Tech.\n\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard are expected to appeal the U.K. decision in a British court. While the EU ruling could provide some marginal support for their case, it will be a stiff test\u2014with the U.K.'s CMA having a strong historical record of prevailing against appeals. Analysts at Raymond James last week put the chances of a successful deal at just 10% to 15%.\n\nA more radical alternative put forward by analysts at Macquarie Research would be for Microsoft to close the deal anyway and look to bypass British objections by not offering Activision content on any cloud-gaming services in the U.K, including its own.\n\n\"[That] would result in a legal battle with the CMA but one we think worth fighting as it is precedent-setting for an acquisitive company to allow one country to block a $75 billion deal,\" the Macquarie analysts wrote.\n\nWere Microsoft to take on such a battle and win, it could have a meaningful implication for its peers and beyond. While it would rile the U.K. regulator, it could also neuter its impact on the global regulatory stage.\n\nShould Microsoft leave the CMA decision unchallenged, it could embolden regulators far and wide that have previously left most decisions to bigger peers.\n\nbarrons.com/articles/microso\u2026",

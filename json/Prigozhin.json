Personally I use estimates because the data coming out of both sides is so abysmally unbalanced.  \n\nFor instance - Prigozhin said in his interview that Wagner lost around 10k prisoners and 10k professionals - but that Ukraine lost 5x more.  \n\nHow did he get that number?  Did Wagner count all the dead bodies?  Did they unearth all the destroyed buildings?  \n\nAnd his own figure about Wagner deaths goes against what the Russian MOD has been saying.  \n\nThe problem with an information war is that the information is just so unreliable right now",

Prigozhin warned that the Russian elite is fostering a situation that could end up like the revolution of 1917, in which soldiers and their loved ones stood up against the Russian government. Prigozhin threatened that the Russian public may become violent towards the Russian elite, referencing mobs with pitchforks and alluding to the St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day Massacre, a string of politically motivated mob assassinations in France in 1572. Prigozhin\u2019s somewhat subtle and purposefully obscure threats of violence represent an inflection in his longstanding feuds with the Russian military establishment and select elite figures.\"",

        "text": "PRIGOZHIN'S LATEST INTERVIEW:\n\n The head of Wagner PMC Yevgeny Prigozhin gave an hour and a half interview to media technologist Konstantin Dolgov. Although throughout the conversation they go over and over again through the Russian elites and the decision-making system, there are quite interesting details in the interview that can be perceived without emotional overtones.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fBy June 1 - with a backlash of up to 10 days - PMCs should \"as correctly\" transfer Bakhmut to units of the RF Armed Forces. If the Russian Ministry of Defense is unable to do this, then this fact, according to Prigozhin, will discredit the RF Armed Forces and make PMCs more combat-ready than regular troops. And from the point of view of public administration, this is incorrect.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fAt the beginning of the siege of Bakhmut, there were 35 thousand fighters in the ranks of PMCs. For all the time of the NWO , 50 thousand people were recruited among the prisoners. 20% of them ( 10 thousand prisoners ) died in battle. Another 10 thousand full-time PMC fighters also died.\n\nAccording to the results of the battle for Bakhmut (Artyomovsk), the loss of the Armed Forces of Ukraine killed - 50 thousand people, wounded - 50-70 thousand people.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fIf Artyomovsk is surrendered, then Wagner PMC will first go \u201cwithin the law and in jackets with bloody hands\u201d to Frunzenskaya Embankment to ask uncomfortable questions, and then they will go again to save the Motherland.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fTerritorial defense is the most pragmatic decision that could be made in the current conditions. It is not the task of the FSB to fight off the DRG, but the Ministry of Defense. And the locals could help.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fAccording to Prigozhin, the ideal candidates for the post of Minister of Defense and Chief of the General Staff are Mizintsev and Surovikin. The minister of defense, he said, should not be a \"political figure\" but deal with the military machine.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f\u201cSociety always demands justice\u201d, and if there is no justice, then \u201crevolutionary moods arise\u201d.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fHurrah-patriotism is good only for a short period of time. And jingoistic patriotism based on invented facts makes \u201cpeople play the fool and do nothing\u201d \u2013 this is the \u201cNavalny effect\u201d.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe war is p$dorastic in nature, both sides call each other p$doras.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fPrigogine's political credo: \"I love Russia, I don't care about Shoigu, we will continue to fight.\"\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fThere are two scenarios - an optimistic one, which Prigogine does not believe in, and a not very optimistic one. The first option is that Europe and the United States will get tired, China will put everyone at the negotiating table, where Russia will say to the taken territories \u201cThis is all ours\u201d and they will listen to it.\n\nThe pessimistic scenario is that the Ukrainians are given missiles, they have trained troops and command staff, equipment, they will continue fighting and counterattack (possibly successfully), and then they will try to restore the borders until 2014. For Russia, this scenario will not be good, so you need to prepare for a difficult war.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fWe need to stop building glass towers and fattening, we need to work only for the war, transferring all production to military needs and declaring additional waves of mobilization. First you need to stabilize the front, and only then deal with civilian things.",

        "text": "Prigozhin claims that 20,000 Wagner mercenaries have been killed in Bakhmut. Maybe he is not lying because he wants to blame the Russian MoD for his losses, but I think he has also enough reason to claim a smaller number. Let's say it is somewhere between:\n\n20,000 \u2013 25,000 KIA\n\nThe fact that Prigozhin does not disclose the numbers of wounded is noteworthy. But you can estimate WIA based on KIA. In Western armies the ratio is between 10:1 and 17:1, due to good medical treatment, a high probability rate from being retrieved from the battlefield and the overall good morale of the troops.\n\nFor Russian soldiers and mercenaries those values drop in all aspects. The most optimistic ratio is 5:1 which might be possible for an ordinary army regular in open field such as in Vuhledar, but in a meat grinder like Bakhmut and using inmates it is dropping fast to somewhere at 2:1 or 1.5:1, which makes around:\n\n30,000 \u2013 50,000 WIA\n\nThis, however, are only the numbers of PMC Wagner. You have to add the losses of the regular Russian army, especially at the flanks, though it is likely that the bulk of numbers are Wagner mercs. An additional 20,000 \u2013 30,000 casualties (KIA+WIA) by regular Russian army soldiers over this long period of 10 months is possible.\n\nOverall we are now talking about 70,000 \u2013 105,000 Russian casualties.\n\nReflecting those numbers, which are normal battlefield arithmetic, we see that those 100,000 estimated Russian casualties by Western intelligences are in this range and they have more and reliable data at hand. The poor conditions of Russian infirmaries ensure that the total loss rate of WIA will be higher than average, as well. \n\nIt explains why Prigozhin was eager to declare the withdrawal. This high attrition rate could be only compensated as long as new inmates were send it. Wagner PMC curiously never had more than +50,000 troops at the same time. Again, it was literally a meat grinder. \"Go in! Die! Next! Rinse and repeat!\" \n\nIt is hard to estimate their current strength because it is unclear when the Russian MoD stopped the recruitment in prisons and how effective they have been, but the real danger which PMC Wagner poses right now is for the current Russian leadership, since - as initially said - Prigozhin is already after the Russian MoD. It is obvious that he is making the Russian MoD responsible for the high losses which Prigozhin himself put in ratio with Ukrainians by 5:1 (for each killed Ukrainian, 5 killed mercs).\n\nWe will know the exact numbers only after the war, if ever, but even with those estimations at hand it is absolutely certain what an insane military adventure the Russian advance in Bakhmut was. This makes even the Soviet adventure in Afghanistan, which lasted 10 years and resulted in 12,000 Soviet KIAs, look like a failed little skirmish.",

They practically coincide with the calculations of the War Tears project, which, according to its methodology, gave 55,000 AFU losses, based on the calculation of the established losses of the AFU units noted in Artemovsk and regional obituaries.\n\nWagner's losses amounted to up to 20% of the total killed and up to 20% wounded.\n\nAt the peak, the number of PMCs \"Wagner\" reached up to 50 000, according to Prigozhin.\n\nThe AFU group defending Artemovsk numbered up to 82 000 people. (which coincides with the  estimates that estimated the AFU grouping in the Artemovsk area was at 75-85 000 people.\n\nPrigozhin main statements from the interview:\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fWe fought in Bakhmut against superior forces, destroyed about 50,000 AFU military and wounded up to 70,000\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe Wagner PMCs had 3.2 times fewer dead than the AFU, and about 2 times fewer wounded.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe PMCs in Artemovsk had 50,000 people at the best moments, and the AFU had 82,000, and the ratio for the assault should be 3 to 1 for the stormers.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f During the operation, I selected 50,000 prisoners, 20% of them died, another 20% were injured.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe goal of Artemovsk was not Artemovsk itself, but the \"Bakhmut meat grinder\". And in Artemovsk, we destroyed everyone we were supposed to destroy, completed the task.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe task was completed due to the highest level of organization.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f And we have our own: planes, helicopters, air defense, artillery, MLRS, reconnaissance and even our own satellite reconnaissance.\n\nRegarding the Belgorod situation that was not part of the interview Prigozhin said:\n\n\"When I announced few months ago that I would train fighters in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, several events happened.\n\nFirst: Defense Minister Shoigu called me and said indignantly: \"Do not climb, Evgeny Viktorovich, where it is not necessary. The Russian army itself is capable of defending the borders.\"\n\nSecondly, there were several meetings with the governors, who also asked to study independently.\n\nThat's when they will fuck up everything and people with pitchforks will go out into the street, of course, then we will come and defend. This is our homeland.\n\nBureaucrats, they are to blame for the fact that the enemy breaks through.\"",

Full version. about #Bakhmut\n\nAccording to the results of the battle for # Bakhmut (#Artyomovsk), the loss of the Armed Forces of Ukraine killed - 50 thousand people, wounded - 50-70 thousand people.\n\n\"Answers to  questions\"\n\n\u201cIf Artyomovsk is surrendered, then Wagner PMC will first go \u201cwithin the law and in jackets with bloody hands\u201d to Frunzenskaya Embankment to ask uncomfortable questions, and then they will go again to save the Motherland\u201d\nWhat Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a big interview\n\nThe head of Wagner PMC Yevgeny Prigozhin gave an hour and a half interview to media technologist Konstantin Dolgov. This is written by the TG-channel \"Rybar\". Although throughout the conversation they go over and over again through the Russian elites and the decision-making system, there are quite interesting details in the interview that can be perceived without emotional overtones.\n\nBy June 1 - with a backlash of up to 10 days - PMCs should \"as correctly as possible\" transfer Bakhmut to units of the RF Armed Forces. If the Russian Ministry of Defense is unable to do this, then this fact, according to Prigozhin, will discredit the RF Armed Forces and make PMCs more combat-ready than regular troops. And from the point of view of public administration, this is incorrect.\n\nAt the time of the beginning of the siege of Bakhmut, there were 35 thousand fighters in the ranks of PMCs. For all the time of the NWO, 50 thousand people were recruited among the prisoners. 20% of them (10 thousand prisoners) died in battle. Another 10 thousand full-time PMC fighters also died.\n\nAccording to the results of the battle for Bakhmut (Artyomovsk), the loss of the Armed Forces of Ukraine killed - 50 thousand people, wounded - 50-70 thousand people.\n\nIf Artyomovsk is surrendered, then Wagner PMC will first go \u201cwithin the law and in jackets with bloody hands\u201d to Frunzenskaya Embankment to ask uncomfortable questions, and then they will go again to save the Motherland.\n\nTerritorial defense is the most pragmatic decision that could be made under the current conditions. It is not the task of the FSB to fight off the DRG, but the Ministry of Defense. And the locals could help.\n\nAccording to Prigozhin, Mizintsev and Surovikin are ideal candidates for the positions of Minister of Defense and Chief of the General Staff. The minister of defense, he said, should not be a \"political figure\" but deal with the military machine.\n\n\u201cSociety always demands justice,\u201d and if there is no justice, then \u201crevolutionary moods arise.\u201d\n\nHooray-patriotism is good only for a short period of time. And jingoistic patriotism based on invented facts makes \u201cpeople play the fool and do nothing\u201d \u2013 this is the \u201cNavalny effect*\u201d.\n\nPrigozhin's political credo: \"I love Russia, I don't care about Shoigu, we will continue to fight.\"\n\nThere are two scenarios - an optimistic one, which Prigogine does not believe in, and a not very optimistic one. The first option is that Europe and the United States will get tired, China will put everyone at the negotiating table, where Russia will say to the taken territories \u201cThis is all ours\u201d and they will listen to it.\n\nThe pessimistic scenario is that the Ukrainians are given missiles, they have trained troops and command staff, equipment, they will continue fighting and counterattack (possibly successfully), and then they will try to restore the borders until 2014. For Russia, this scenario will not be good, so you need to prepare for a difficult war.\n\nWe need to stop building glass towers and fattening ourselves, we need to work only for the war, transferring all production to military needs and declaring additional waves of mobilization. First you need to stabilize the front, and only then deal with civilian things.",

        "text": "Yevgeny Prigozhin - about the progress of the SVO: \"If we want to return Ukraine to the \"pro-Russian bosom\", we need to change the top of power, kiss the people in the ass and invite them to ourselves. What did we do instead? We walked around the territory with boots in search of the Nazis. While we were looking for the Nazis, they sausaged everyone they could. We approached Kiev, then, I call it Russian, - they shit themselves and moved away. Then to Kherson - they shit themselves and moved away. After that or before -Isum, Krasnyj Lyman. And somehow everything doesn't work out for us. Joseph Vissarionovich would draw conclusions - he shot 200 people... But we haven't made any conclusions yet.\"",

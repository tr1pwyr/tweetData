Trump's mouth is the same mouth that got him elected in 2016. Independents like myself do not care how he speaks. Obama spoke eloquently & look where that got us. \nHow do you think you would speak about your treatment if you and your family went through what he's going through? \nTrump has a proven track record and especially with foreign policy. He has proven he can get peace and keep new wars & ISIS away. He had the lowest unemployment and employed in decades. Poverty went down for every demographic. His stock market skyrocketed. he gave us energy independence and would have been able to get our debt paid off with the oil.\nMiami was already going red for years because of the Trump policies and Trump supporters out working the communities to get voters.\nDeSantis will have millions against his 6 week abortion ban and that is no exaggeration. People are worried he will completely ban them. Moderate democrats think Ron is more radical than Trump & the media has been happy to show them this.",

        "text": "In 2020, China and the Dems unleashed Covid-19 in order to defeat Trump. Would they start WW3 to keep him out of office in 2024?\n\nChina wants Taiwan back, and Biden is their puppet. They have to move on their ambitions before Trump is elected and they no longer have control of the country. Biden has been doing everything he can to weaken our country militarily, sending our armory to Ukraine, spending the strategic petroleum reserve for mid-term votes, depleting our ranks with DEI and trans/queer ideology, slashing their budget (the only cuts he approves of), lowering entrance standards, so our ability to defeat China in a shooting war is in question. If we are in the middle of a WW3 quagmire come 2024, they'll be screaming that elections must be suspended. And look at all the strange headlines lately: senators given satellite phones in anticipation of a 'disruptive event', malicious Chinese hacker code discovered in Guam US military complex computers, 500 Chinese nationals crossing Biden's (by design) wide open southern boarder per week, 60 tons of amonium nitrate goes missing, US govt buys 290 million in anti-radiation meds. This is just the past couple weeks!\n\nCovid-19 proved the Dems will kill you to defeat Trump and stay in power. Get ready for the sequel. Or, as Joe would say, \"gird your loins.\"",

DeSantis has blocked China from buying land in Florida.  China bought more farmland under Trump than any other administration. Again, if you\u2019re not a hypocrite, you will dump trump",

Deep State got Trump to quickly remove most of the MAGA staff from White House while keeping the ones they wanted in there.\n\n2. Trump didn\u2019t do one thing to drain any of the swamp like he promised, NOT ONE Executive Order!\n\n3. Trump didn\u2019t create one executive order to protect Americans from deep state surveillance\n\n4. Trump didn\u2019t create one executive order to prevent election fraud while whining it was going to happened\n\n5. Trump Ignored persecuted supporters like J6 folks & hasn't lifted a finger to help them or any other person who suffered for supporting Trump. He throws all loyal supporters under the bus once they are are no longer useful (see Michael Flynn)\n\n6. COVID response!!!\n\n7. Trump was a billion dollar boom to leftwing Corporate Media (& a narcissist just like them)\n\n8. DC/FBI harassed & raided Trump's loyal MAGA staff while ignoring his Deep State staff (& Trump's raid was treated lightly with zero handcuffs)\n\n9. Trump is connected to CIA thru Epstein connections (see Whitney Webb\u2019s work)\n\n10. Trump is used by Deep State to create a counter cult on the opposite side of the Woke cult to \"Divide & Conquer\" all the useful idiot masses blinded by their tribal zealotry\n\n11. Trump helped DeepState to unite Hilary/Obama Establishment Dems+Neocon RHINO war criminals+ Corporate Oligarchs + Govt industrial complex + the\nderanged woke cult ALL TOGETHER with blind devotion (mass psychosis)\n\n12. Trump is the deep state's wet dream since they can use him to justify their tyrannical actions. See Jan 6, Patriot Front false flag, Hamilton68\n\n13. If Trump really cared about America's future more than his enormously fragile ego, he would get behind a younger candidate with great potential to help shape a better future for all Americans. He won't because he's either too arrogant or as I suspect a puppet to something more nefarious.\n\nPeople need to wake the F*ck up out of their coma cuz the deep state is far more in control & powerful than they truly understand. One way you can see this is by how more brazen they are becoming.\n\nWe have a NARROW gap of opportunity to organize together to stop them. Sadly I don't see any large groups or personalities with the foresight and urgency to make this happened. \n\nTime is running out!!!",

We saw it in Trump\u2019s Administration- he asked - he demanded - they ignored.\n\nLesson learned: if the administrative state does not like what they are told they will choose to circumvent the most powerful seat in our nation. \n\nIf you manage the money you actually have the leverage to ensure the President\u2019s leadership direction is enforced. \n\nA great interview today by journalist @nataliegwinters today with the insider regarding staff mgmt and cabinet member mgmt shared the same sentiment.",

Ron DeSantis as a governor of the state of Florida, followed Trump\u00b4s policies until at least the end of 2020 (more or less). I am not sure about the timing, but at some point Ron DeSantis made a 180 degree turn and decided to open up the State of Florida and the rest is pretty recent history. \n\nPlease, do tell me how can Trump explain or justify what has been done under his presidency with the knowledge we have now about the virus, big pharma and co. \n\nIt\u00b4s a legit genuine question of domestic and foreign policy. \n\nI am all ears, again.",

        "text": "That's hella funny! It's nice to have a president with a sense of humor. People know it's fake! Do they really think anybody's going to think Hitler's alive and that the devil showed up? \n\nDeSantis people thought it was funny  to, within minutes of Trump's indictment, use a decades-old rape claim with no evidence, to distract Trump and opportunity to hide the fact that DeSantis people filed to reverse resign to run, lower reporting for election, past and future, fund and travel so DeSantis could hide what he was doing and who he was doing it with from his constituents and the world, and worse, DeSantis signed those laws so that he could defraud his own constituents!\n\nDeSantis has been accused of partying with his students. Yet, DeSantis people had a crap fit when people talked about that, but they thought it was okay when DeSantis said, \"I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a pornstar\". All of that is provably fake and everybody knows it because the Democrats had to go around the Constitution to create a temporary law to violate Trump's rights to due process and judgment by a jury of his peers!  \n\nThey thought it was okay for DeSantis to sign a book deal with Harper Collins, Rupert Murdoch's book company, to fund his book tour creating a conflict of interest considering Murdoch is the owner of FOX News, which has been fired election fraud, and Trump truth fact checker, Tucker, promoting DeSantis and has essentially silenced Trump from the moment FOX announced Arizona for Biden, settled Dominion lawsuit and then both Dominion and FOX claim the machines aren't compromised and neither is FOX without a single shred of evidence entered to prove any of their claims! \n\nThey thought it was okay that DeSantis campaigned for never Trumper O'Dea and changed rules so never Trumper Sasse got the presidency at University Of Florida? They thought it was funny when DeSantis talked crap about Trump's COVID policies even though DeSantis followed every bit of advice the COVID team offered, even though Trump silenced them after less than a month from presidential press briefings, and EO'd schedule F so he could fire Fauci and other federal employees, and Trump refused the request of that COVID team to mandate or EO, yet DeSantis WANTED A SHOT IN EVERY ARM! \n\nThey think it's okay that DeSantis has been shadow campaigning for months. 3 months after promising his constituents that he would govern 4 years when he answered Crist in the debate saying, \u201cThe only worn-out, old donkey I\u2019m looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist,\u201d, and revealing on the Fox and Friends show,\n\"As we get beyond\" (the legislative session), \"then we can decide from there\"\nGuess what? The legislative session is over and he's running!\n\nThey think it's funny that DeSantis allowed the division in the party almost an entire 7 months. Watching as his minions and paid schills attacked Trump supporters who had every right to defend the leading Republican presidential candidate and the leading presidential candidate PERIOD!!! Trump announced, DeSantis didn't and those schills were taking credit for all of Trump's policies as they were attacking Trump, and why were they?\n\nHow can they support DeSantis again?\n\nThe only people who had any standing to root for a candidate were supporters of those who we're actually verified and announced candidates, so why was anyone rooting for an unannounced, unverified DeSantis? Because they knew he was running! They're just as slimy and underhanded as he is because as he was shadow campaigning and handicapping Trump with his passive aggressive tactics, they were shadowing and handicapping Trump voters by virtue and signal shaming them with the claim DeSantis wasn't running being the cowards they are!",

Democrats, media & Republicans!  \nThe death counter 24/7 on CNN/MSNBC! 1. He first appointed Peter Navarro to handle the pandemic but Peter was pushed out by Pence & Pence's COS!\n  2. Fauci was lying to Trump the whole time! \n 3. They also slammed him when he tried to push prophylactics like HCQ, Vit D, Zinc etc. \n 4. They made him jump through hoops to supply/MFG ventilators. \n5.  Set up pop-up hospitals like at the Javitz Center and the ships USNS Comfort and Mercy (not even used).\n   6. They hit him on playing down the virus not wanting to create a panic.  - All done in the first 2-4 months.  \n7. They blamed him for every death. \n 8. Fauci and Birx et al never told Trump the vaccine wasn't a true vaccine. (see Peter Navarro's substack article attached with more he describes because he was there!)\n9. They created a panic to force Trump (who only wanted to save lives) into their plans to ruin HIS economy for election purposes.\n   10. He never wanted to lock down. See attached screenshots of a March 20th 2020 covid briefing on if he'll lockdown. I'll also attach a short video in another comment below this.\n ****DeSantis slammed him when he said we didn't need to lock down! See attached article screenshot!",

        "text": "Please try to debunk one point here\n\nWhy YOU Shouldn\u2019t Trust #DeepStateDonald:\n\n1. Deep State got Trump to quickly remove most of the MAGA staff from White House while keeping the ones they wanted in there.\n\n2. Trump didn\u2019t do one thing to drain any of the swamp like he promised, NOT ONE Executive Order!\n\n3. Trump didn\u2019t create one executive order to protect Americans from deep state surveillance\n\n4. Trump didn\u2019t create one executive order to prevent election fraud while whining it was going to happened\n\n5. Trump Ignored persecuted supporters like J6 folks & hasn't lifted a finger to help them or any other person who suffered for supporting Trump. He throws all loyal supporters under the bus once they are are no longer useful (see Michael Flynn)\n\n6. COVID response!!!\n\n7. Trump was a billion dollar boom to leftwing Corporate Media (& a narcissist just like them)\n\n8. DC/FBI harassed & raided Trump's loyal MAGA staff while ignoring his Deep State staff (& Trump's raid was treated lightly with zero handcuffs)\n\n9. Trump is connected to CIA thru Epstein connections (see Whitney Webb\u2019s work)\n\n10. Trump is used by Deep State to create a counter cult on the opposite side of the Woke cult to \"Divide & Conquer\" all the useful idiot masses blinded by their tribal zealotry\n\n11. Trump helped DeepState to unite Hilary/Obama Establishment Dems+Neocon RHINO war criminals+ Corporate Oligarchs + Govt industrial complex + the\nderanged woke cult ALL TOGETHER with blind devotion (mass psychosis)\n\n12. Trump is the deep state's wet dream since they can use him to justify their tyrannical actions. See Jan 6, Patriot Front false flag, Hamilton68\n\n13. If Trump really cared about America's future more than his enormously fragile ego, he would get behind a younger candidate with great potential to help shape a better future for all Americans. He won't because he's either too arrogant or as I suspect a puppet to something more nefarious.\n\nPeople need to wake the F*ck up out of their coma cuz the deep state is far more in control & powerful than they truly understand. One way you can see this is by how more brazen they are becoming.\n\nWe have a NARROW gap of opportunity to organize together to stop them. Sadly I don't see any large groups or personalities with the foresight and urgency to make this happened. \n\nTime is running out!!!",

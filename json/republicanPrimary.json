A presidential candidate, announcing their candidacy live on a social network.\n\nPresidential primaries are one of the best examples of how ranked choice voting could benefit our electoral process. In some states, the Republican Party uses RCV for their primaries with great benefit, resulting in a consensus candidate with broad support, such as Virginia. \n\nBut the national party does not. The system they use for Presidential Primaries, single-choice voting, or plurality, or first-past-the-post, encourages finger-pointing and name-calling and rewards negative campaigning. The more candidates enter the race, the fewer votes you need to win. A crowded field can produce a winner that has very little support. See 2016.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how nasty this primary process gets, and how good the Republican Party feels about their nominee when it\u2019s all said and done.\n\nMy prediction: chaos",

        "text": "Judge Schedules Trump Trial in the Middle of Primaries, Months Before Election\n\nThe trial involving Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels has been scheduled for March 25, 2024. The timing places the trial in the middle of the Republican primaries and just months before the presidential election, which could potentially impact Trump\u2019s political activities.\n\nSponsor: \nAugusta Precious Metals - GET YOUR FREE GOLD IRA INFO NOW  \ud83d\udc49 augustapreciousmetals.com/ap\u2026\n\nTrump appeared visibly irritated during a virtual court appearance when the trial date was announced. He is facing charges related to a series of payments, including a $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records at his family company, the Trump Organization\u200b.\n\nThe scheduling of the trial could interfere with Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in a few ways.\n\nTrials can take several weeks or even months to conclude, particularly in complex cases. During this time, Trump could need to spend significant time preparing for the trial, attending court sessions, and responding to developments in the case. This could reduce the time he has available to campaign, attend rallies, meet with supporters, and perform other tasks associated with running for president.\n\nThe trial\u2019s subject matter involves controversial issues that could potentially harm Trump\u2019s public image as well, especially considering the charges are related to payments to Stormy Daniels and others. Depending on how the trial proceedings unfold, they could lead to negative press coverage that might sway public opinion.\n\nDepending on the outcome of the trial, Trump could also face legal consequences that might impact his ability to run for or serve in office.\u00a0The timing of the trial coincides with important events in the Republican primary campaign, including the \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d primaries and the Florida contest that pits Trump against Governor Ron DeSantis. These events are crucial in securing the party nomination, and any distractions or absences could potentially impact his performance in these contests.\n\nFull story: trendingpoliticsnews.com/bre\u2026",

The majority of the GOP is made up of RINOs and there\u2019s very little difference between a RINO and a Democrat. In other words, the uni-party is real. \n\n2nd editor\u2019s note: Trump\u2019s endorsement/appointment record is absolutely indefensible with no signs of change.

His only interest is in dividing the republican party for primary, which uses up all time and energy on a primary fight instead of getting ready for general election, including lining up ballot harvesting and saving advertising ammo for general campaign.  Even when his dirty deed is done and he never gets elected again, he will be like Bernie Sanders and walk away with millions of dollars laundered through his wife and book deals.  I and millions of other Trump supporters who see Trump is taking the deep state out in background will work tirelessly to see that DeSantis NEVER reaches the oval office.  2024, 2028, 2032, etc.  Since Trump is still CIC and our national guard and military are rounding up all the bad guys around the world for Gitmo, it should be obvious to an intelligent guy like you what is going on.  You and others are committing treason in my opinion.  If you are so smart, how can the national guard be flying all over the globe on missions outside their state?  Only one answer is true.  Once you research and figure it out you will suddenly realize all what I am saying here is true.",

Vote for whoever you want to in the Primary/Primaries but in the General Election VOTE for the nominee who wins. DON'T STAY HOME AND POUT AND NOT VOTE simply because the Republican nominee is not who you voted for in the Primary/Primaries. If you do, DON'T YOU DARE BITCH about who wins the position of POTUS.\n\nWe were having an issue with the MSM trying to pass a narrative supporting those issues that the Liberal Democrats want to shove down our throats. They support Drag Queen Shows with little children in places where these are being held. Bars, Restaurants, Children's Birthday Parties, in the military, churches, and on the streets.  The ones doing this are wrong. IT MUST BE STOPPED before there is no way to back out of it. \n\nThese Drag Queens are trying to make a living and they can do that (in a Drag Queen Bar. If adults want to go to see them, then it ought to be in a DQ Bar with only 'adults' (age of 18+) attending. The shows are a way to 'groom' children because their MOMMIES THINK IT IS COOL. I cannot believe the Baby-Daddies are thrilled about it, but apparently they are not involved with their child(ren).\n\nSome of the pictures being posted are of people dressed like creeps. I've seen tweets of one crawling up to a little girl like he was a cat. She did not seem to thrilled, but her Mama was standing right there encouraging her to let him get even closer.\n\nI'll stop at that. And comments are welcome.",

        "text": "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8BREAKING: A New York judge has scheduled Donald Trump\u2019s CRIMINAL TRIAL for March 2024. \n\nThat means the trial will take place BEFORE the 2024 election.\n\nThis is HUGE development that will send shockwaves throughout the Republican primary that could extend to the general election. \n\nThe trial date was set during a brief hearing Tuesday in which Judge Juan Merchan read Trump an order on what he can and cannot say publicly about the case and evidence his legal team will get from prosecutors to prepare for trial.\n\nTrump appeared remotely via video feed so the judge could communicate with him in open court. \n\nTrump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. \n\nJudge Merchan also cautioned Trump and his attorneys that Trump's violation of the order preventing him from publicly disclosing evidence could result in sanctions.\n\n\"Violation of a court order or court mandate could result in sanctions which include a finding of contempt which is punishable,\" Merchan said.\n\nLET\u2019S GO!!!!",

        "text": "Folks, with the 2024 Republican nomination contest just starting to gear up (yes, its just starting! In fact, it won\u2019t \u2018start\u2019 for the bulk of the Republican primary electorate until October or November) it\u2019s time to discuss one of the main limitations, and abuses of, presidential nomination polling.\n\nIn 2019 and early 2020, I spent A LOT of time trying to explain most 2020 Democratic primary voters had no idea who Pete Buttigieg or Beto O\u2019Rourke even were.\n\nEven after Beto\u2019s exciting Texas senate bid that raised more than $70 million dollars in 2018, 40% of Democratic Party (primary voters are the most engaged voters in the entire nation) had no idea who he was. DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY VOTERS.\n\nThis is why I continue to bang the drum that presidential nomination campaigns begin and end on name ID. Those who have reached saturation name ID the year heading into the primary year will usually be the same one or two candidates who end up being competitive to actually win the nomination. The rest of the field is filler (but don\u2019t cry for them, running for president even as a long shot candidate comes with many excellent consolation prizes).\n\nI mention all of this again because we\u2019re already starting to see polling data that is asking questions of favorability data the data itself can not answer.\n\nCase in point, this Harvard CAPS Harris poll which presents favorability margins for the Republican primary field along with some other notable political figures like Elon Musk and *Vivek Ramaswamy* (yes, those are sarcasm asterisks).\n\nI want you to pay close attention to the dark and light gray bands in this data because it will tell you a lot about the American electorate. Once you move past the former Vice President Mike Pence, you\u2019ll start to see name ID take a sharp nose dive. 34% of respondents were like Nikki who? For all your angst about Kristin Sinema 55% of American voters have no idea who she is.\n\nTim Scott\u2019s biggest problem won\u2019t be convincing Republican Party primary voters he\u2019s a better nominee than Donald Trump, its convincing Republican primary voters he exists, and as far as nomination politics goes, its a tale as old as time.\n\nGiven this voter \u2018knowledge\u2019 constraint, it\u2019s important for pollsters to acknowledge the limitations of data like these in terms of being able to draw substantive insights.\n\nYou can compare net favorability for political figures with comparable name ID saturation with each other. For example, net favorability between Biden, Trump, Harris, Musk, Putin, Desantis, Clinton, and probably Pence are valid inferences to draw from these data. Outside of the high name ID subgroup, you aren\u2019t measuring net favorability. And by limiting our analysis in this way, we can learn one very interesting takeaway: America loves celebrities. Always have (here\u2019s looking at you Ronnie and Arnold), always will.\n\nOne final note: I get poo poo\u2019d on this quite a bit from other strategists but the biggest strategic advantage House Republicans have right now is that like in 2010, Republicans can use control of the House to drag down Biden\u2019s approvals and remain largely invisible while they do it. As of May 2023, 32% of voters have no idea who Kevin McCarthy is. If we want to win in 2024, we need to change that. It will not change itself.\n\nLike this post?

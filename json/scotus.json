        "text": "The recent scandals involving Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton highlight a larger issue of political corruption in the United States. These cases demonstrate how massive wealth, both domestic and foreign, seeks to buy power and cultivate relationships with those in positions of influence. This pattern of wealthy individuals enlisting the powerful to maintain the status quo has existed since the early days of the Republic. The connection between wealth, corruption, and right-wing politics is evident at both the state and national levels. Research suggests that corruption tends to be more prevalent when right-wing parties are in power, as those with wealth and power often support conservative politicians who protect their interests. Corruption and efforts to preserve economic inequality go hand in hand, with political institutions serving the interests of economic elites to the detriment of ordinary people. The fight against corruption requires speaking out against the oligarchs who seek to undermine democracy and equal opportunity, and taking action to curb the power of public officials influenced by wealthy individuals.\n\nsalon.com/2023/06/02/clarenc\u2026",

        "text": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has consistently ruled in favor of wealthy political donors like Harlan Crow, often opposing donor disclosure and contribution limits. His decisions have been seen as benefiting the wealthy and powerful, allowing them to influence elections without public scrutiny. Thomas's stance was particularly evident in the 2010 Citizens United case, where he supported the removal of campaign finance laws, enabling unlimited and often unaccountable money in elections. He has also argued against having any contribution limits in politics. Critics argue that Thomas's rulings and his acceptance of gifts from Crow represent ethical breaches. His decisions have been seen as undermining democracy, accountability, and judicial ethics.\n\ncitizensforethics.org/news/a\u2026",

Practical win for Democrats and a symbolic one for Republicans\n\nRestrictions on emergency cash aid TANF is going to hit folks hard. The idea is to force people back into the workforce. Let\u2019s see what happens \n\nStreamline energy project permit \u201cnudges\u201d us in a better direction to compete with infrastructure advances \n\nFunding cuts to the money the IRS was allocated from the Inflation act does scream big interest has struck again. Hopefully nimble leadership in the department pivots. \n\nUnused Covid money being rescinded seems like basic math \n\nCaps military budget for 2 years is also a refresher for once considering that it increased the last 2 years \n\nOVERALL in this current political climate and rhetoric fueled era of politics I\u2019m glad we still have adults in the room.

Can you call what's on this tape \"an armed coup attempt.\" Or is this a tape showing demonstrators engaged in civil disobedience?\n\nThere was notice of this event weeks in advance. The FBI had infiltrated all the major groups organizing the event. This was no surprise.\n\nHad the Speaker's office staffed up for the J6 demonstration and taken reasonable precautions... Had the Capitol police been more professional... Had there been a National Guard cordon around the Capitol... These people would have never made it into the building and, if they somehow had, they could be ordered to leave & arrested if they failed to comply.\n\nInstead, Democrats & the National security agencies got what they wanted. A conservative, MAGA crowd that engaged in a riot that violated the Nation's Capitol building thus shocking the nation. With very, very little to support their mantra that the greatest threat to America is white nationalists & extremist MAGA types, this fit the bill perfectly.",

We have to save ourselves through radical non-compliance and/or civil disobedience. \n\nIt looks like this movie hits a lot of the themes with one caveat. I believe that a coordinated #bankrun now defeats the movement towards centralization and digital tyranny. You don\u2019t have to vote for me or anyone to make it happen. Check my pinned tweet. \n\n#EndTheFed, #StopWW3, #HaltCBDC - Bank Run Now!",

        "text": "The same God who wrote John 3:16 also wrote Psalms 5:5.\n\nGod is love, yes. But BECAUSE God is love, He must also hate.\n\nPaul Washer puts it well: \"If I love that which is holy, I must hate that which is unholy. See, I love children therefore I hate abortion.\"\n\nOur God is a holy God and His hatred of sin (and workers of iniquity) is measured, it is just, and it is necessary because it is truth.\n\nWe cannot simply ignore God's righteous anger and hatred as recorded in Scripture because it sounds mean; that is blasphemous idolatry.\n\nNow, we can discuss and debate what Psalms 5 and similar verses mean and how that fits with God's other attributes, but we mustn't reject them or explain them away by our own reasoning apart from Scripture.\n\n#MyThreeCents",

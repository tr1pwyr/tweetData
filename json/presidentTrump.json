He's hoping and praying that President Trump will be taken out of the race by a corrupt Biden DOJ so he has a chance to win the Republican Nomination. I'm surprised he's making COVID Vaccines such a big part of his campaign. I watched almost every DeSantis livestream until he started sneaking around meeting with Corporate Donors to beg for money on the down low. DeSantis even changed Florida Law so he can run against President Trump @realDonaldTrump without having to Resign as Governor. He thought Operation Warp Speed was great back then! He gave out COVID Vaccines at all the Wee Wee Stops @Wawa and Pubic Stations @Publix in Florida. DeSantis went to Nursing Homes and Retirement Communities to make sure they all got the Jab. More weenies are announcing all the time thinking they won't have to run against President Trump. I don't think Republican Voters like weenies.

        "text": "Trump is not a racist as proven by his life actions & those of his presidency. Before he was president, when he stood to lose big money, he refused to build a golf club until the members agreed to integrate the club membership --which did happen. Very early in his presidency he met with black business owners to see what they needed to increase the number of black businesses. I heard their comments after the meeting and they explained what they told him. He took those comments and together with Ivanka Trump & Senator Tim Scott arranged funding and opportunity zones in black communities. This brought black employment & wages to all-time highs, including among black teens. Until Covid hit black employment was solid. Donald Trump may have a fresh mouth & can be an annoying name-caller but he is no racist. That lie was sold early by the dims and lots of people bought it. Sad for the country.",

(Although I do recall there was some allowance for campaigning.) \n\nI don't think Elon is doing it for the political affiliation or that it is any kind of endorsement. Elon has said of his ideal candidate:  \"I would prefer, frankly, that we put just a normal person as president, a normal person with common sense and whose values are smack in the middle of the country, just center of the normal distribution and I think that they would be great.\"\n\nI do think an endorsement by Elon is of a lot of value but he voted for Hillary and he voted for Biden. Clearly, he sucks at voting!  \ud83d\ude01\n\nIt doesn't really matter because #Trump2024 is going to #MAGA",

        "text": "#Trump2024TheOnlyChoice \nDonald Trump\u2019s promises if he\u2019s elected\n\n\u2022Most recently: Leading Donald Trump\u2019s list is a controversial pledge to pardon many of the January 6 protesters convicted of federal offenses. On international affairs, the former president intends to promptly mediate a resolution for the ongoing war in Ukraine. \n\u2022The border: Trump wants to leverage the U.S. military against drug cartels in Mexico and street crime. \n\u2022Pro-natal policy: He has also suggested baby bonuses to promote a baby boom and the establishment of 10 \"Freedom Cities,\u201d built from scratch on federal land. \n\u2022Education: Trump plans to exert more federal control over higher education, aiming to dismiss \"radical left\" officials accrediting universities, incentivize the abolition of teacher tenure, cut college administration roles, and remove diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. \n\u2022Crime: He aims to purge \"Marxist prosecutors,\" or weak-on-crime, George Soros-funded prosecutors. \n\u2022Intelligence reform: He wants to institute an auditing system to ensure U.S. intelligence agencies aren\u2019t conducting domestic surveillance and has called on congressional Republicans to \"defund\" the Justice Department and FBI. \n\u2022The deep state: Trump is also proposing sweeping changes to the federal workforce, advocating for the president to have the authority to hire and fire federal workers at will, a move aimed to \"clean out\" officials he regards as disloyal. \n\u2022Transgenderism: Trump proposes a DOJ investigation into Big Pharma and hospital networks for potential cover-ups about long-term side effects of \"sex transitions.\" He threatens to exclude providers offering gender-affirming care from Medicaid and Medicare. \n\u2022Gun control: Trump supports a national concealed carry reciprocity, which would allow those with a concealed carry permit from their home state to enjoy the same privilege nationwide.",

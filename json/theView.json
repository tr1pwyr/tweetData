This fear mongering does them no honor, for their sacrifice to FIX the world economy. ANd now your gonna fear monger over your little diva friend\n@RiskReversal_\ntrade gone wrong? his puts are in the dumpster. Yeah you can be good friends, by helping him out of his\n@elonmusk\nhate trades, instead of spreading foo foo to help him save a few bucks. And stop bringing like minded people, that look polished and nice like Rebecca to help out. This is HORRIBLE, it spits and dishonors the poor people of China's sacrifice, all over\n@RiskReversal_\npoorly placed trades...\n@lindayacc\nand\n@elonmusk\nare watching, and so are the general public at large....",

        "text": "okay I will bite... But this is my last comment, because it takes a fool... you know... \n\nMy view is that it is an issue pushed by certain media outlets designed to divide the Democrats and Republicans. For a Libertarian, the division is detrimental, as Libertarian philosophy encompasses a mandala of different beliefs, of which only a small slice of the pie is yellow...\n\nWe are both Libertarians, both running campaigns, my view is that the longer we talk about this as candidates, the more we repel critical thinking individuals, and attract smaller minded individuals that are less likely to vote Libertarian when Biden is the incumbent. Also less likely to donate.\n\nThe LP took several steps in the wrong direction in 2022, which I can partially blame myself for, as I was not in Reno. But the post JoJo mid term was the perfect place for a mutiny by a bunch of newcomers that have no idea the LP has been down this road already (a few times)\n\nfor some whoTF am I context, I was Adam Kokesh's bus driver, VP 2020 sort of (had a bad skateboard accident and backed out for a 2024 POTUS run) did all kinds of work for Vermin, even have my own bootleg Vermin sticker! Went to over 30 music festivals, 20 state conventions... Reached literally millions! on a @RideOnewheel and a megaphone...\n\nVermin in 2020 received more individual donations than any Primary Libertarian candidate ever... The party had more new members and donors than ever before.  The new members did not equal new delegates for Vermin and he received the bronze medal after 5 rounds of ranked voting. \n\nJo/Spike, received the 2nd most votes of any other Libertarian candidate ever. Had Vermin been the nominee, hard evidence says the LP could have won 5% in 2020 and would be in the debates for 2024 (or in this case in a much better position to demand debates)\n\nInstead Spike is on Faux News, denies ever knowing Vermin, kissing Kennedy's arse, trying to make her look \"more Libertarian\" for the cameras. And Jo was always a lost cause.. She is very kind, so I hate to hate on her, but she did not have a clue what was going on or how to run a social media campaign regardless of her experience as VP in 1996.\n\nI am friends with Berhrman, Blevins, (I am one of the few people that is nice to Ogle) made buttons for Stop Cop City and Chase Oliver over the weekend (I sell buttons, hmu if you ever need 1 inch or 1.5 inch buttons!) Vermin of course, Larry Sharpe almost remembers who I am, and you may know me from if I have ever slept on your couch!\n\nBesides being a candidate, I vow to use my technical skills for whoever wins the LP nomination in 2024, and any LP candidate running for any office (even if we disagree on trans kids having their own water fountain or whatever the republicans are talking about)\n\nFact is, Vermin's 2020 campaign was sabotaged by someone that was working for someone within the Mises Caucus, or was manipulated by some outside forces... Spike was never supposed to be Vermin's VP... And after my skateboard accident, I had memory problems that would leave me for days not knowing when or where I was (hence the name trime taveler)\n\nBut I have a 65,568 page radical restructuring plan, and I forgot to add a couple thousand pages about trans children, but it absolutely protects children from being abused exponentially less than they are now in their own schools by students and teachers in public schools and private. \n\nMy thing is unity... we have to find the content that we all agree on... and that is what we push, that is where we gain members, and that is how we gain notoriety after so much mud has been slung in our faces by the olde guard and new guard alike!\n\nSO TLDR... I don't think it is smart for Libertarians to fall for the same divisive issues Republicans and Democrats fall for.\n\ntrimetaveler2024.com",

Its usually far better for learning because 50 years ago people actually wrote things with a view that the content be useful, and clear to others. Its VERY hard to find such writing now, principally because academics & students/postgrads are all under immense pressure to publish, constantly. \n\nPublishing LOTS of papers in impressive sounding journals (so you`ll get your grants next year) means they often have to be pretty much junk, decent work takes a while sadly.\n\nSo, read old stuff. An incomparably excellent source for this is the NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS).\n\nWhilst it contains many incomprehensible papers too, it also contains SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN CRITERIA papers. Very detailed and lengthy manuscripts, if you want to learn how gears work, I can recommend how I learned, by reading:\n\n\"Liquid Rocket Engine Turbopump Gears.\"\n\nThis is the turbopump from the Saturn 1B rocket engine, it has a 32,000rpm, 5000bhp geartrain from the axial flow turbine to power the liquid oxygen pumps using gears just 36.5mm wide. (The H1 engine looks a bit like a German WW2 V2 rocket engine because... )\n\nStuff that sent things into space 50 years ago is probably better than most commercial products are today.\n\nDo yourself a favour, spend some time on the NTRS server and learn >\n\nntrs.nasa.gov/search",

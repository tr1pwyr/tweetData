The majority of intersex children have a gender identity forced on them by parents and medical professionals before they have the ability to verbalise their true gender. It's sadly normal to have medical corrections performed to affirm these assumptions.  Many of these individuals later have to transition (becoming part of the trans-intersex community) to correct these assumptions. Now tell me, who are the ones performing dangerous surgeries on children? It costs you nothing to be kind and accept that there are a multitude of differences between every human, but takes more energy for you to express hate.",

From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n~In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, roughly 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n~In 1935, China established gun control. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.\n~In 1938, Germany established gun control. From 1939 to 1945, roughly 13 million Jews and others, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n~In 1956, Cambodia established gun control. From 1975 to 1977, one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n~In 1964, Guatemala established gun control. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n~In 1970, Uganda established gun control. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n\n~56 million defenseless people, rounded up and exterminated by their \u201cloving\u201d governments in the 20th Century, because of gun control.\n\n~Neither politicians nor evening news, will disseminate this information. \n~Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property; gun-control laws adversely affect only law-abiding citizens. \n~With guns, we are 'citizens.\u2019 Without them, we are \u2018subjects\u2019 or worse, \u2018slaves.\u2019\n\n~During WWII, the Japanese decided not to invade America because they knew most Americans were ARMED! \n~Did you know Switzerland issues every household a gun? Switzerland\u2019s government trains every adult issued a rifle. Switzerland has the lowest gun-related crime rate of any civilized country in the world.\n~Be a firm believer in the 2nd Amendment!\n~Speak loudly and clearly before Biden/Harris/ATF try to silence and disarm us. \n~Don\u2019t let our government make all law-abiding citizens easy targets!",

Using gun control, which was used to keep slaves in check, to be in line with a holiday that celebrates the day slaves in Texas found out they were free,\u00a0is something a clueless white girl would think is okay.\u00a0\n\nGun control isn't about keeping anyone safe; it's about controlling the people who want freedom and is willing to fight in an armed conflict to maintain that freedom. Slaves led armed plantation rebellions in the North and South to free themselves; it was gun control that kept some slaves from fighting for their freedom.",

No penalty. \n\nB) Legally sell your illegal firearm to the federal government.\n\nI want to buy each firearm that the possessor believes is worth relieving himself of for $1000 per fire arm. \n\nAny of these firearms are to be destroyed and recycled into instruments for the public good.\n\nThese guns will have no background check on them, except a listing for them being destroyed.\n\nC) Government Gunsafe Program\n\nI want to have the federal government offer free Gun safes that have the following specifications:\n\n1. 2 Factor  Authentication to open the lock, in the following way: \n\n1. One physical key\n2  One Head of Household Phone Number with corresponding App to offer 2 form authentication to allow entry\n3. One password with a minimum of 16 characters or longer to manually input\n4. Biometric Security access\n\nThe app will also alert you to an emergency if someone is trying to force the safe, and give it the option to call a neighbor and or the police if broken into. \n\nThe safe should be large enough to hold 5 AR 15's and 2000 rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe safe should be strong enough to withstand explosive charges and a sledgehammer.\n\nThe contents of the safe should be safe in temperatures in excess of 2500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAnd the safe should be permanently fixed into place. \n\nBut the gun safe should be a free gift by the United States to those that should wish to express their right to responsibly bare arms, by completing a Gun safety and Shooting Course certifiedand mandated by the Federal Government for responsible citizen Gun ownership.\n\nA Certification will also include a doctor's authorization certifying that this individual is \"safe\" for firearm ownership.\n\nA Constitutional Freedom or a Life in the Pursuit of Liberty and Happiness should never be out of any American Citizen's Price Range.\n\nIt may not be a perfect solution, but it's a step in the Middle Sirection.\n\nThis should prevent or at least hinder efforts toward Gun Violence, while preserving\n \"Every Citizens Right to Bear Arms.\"",

Specifically the human costs from increased incarceration.  I\u2019ve seen estimates that a year in prison lowers life expectancy by 2 years.  Even if you don\u2019t care about gun owners what about their kids ? Putting somebody\u2019s dad in jail likely lowers their life expectancy.  \n\nOne of the numbers I can\u2019t get a handle on is the ratio of compliance to enforcement. What percentage of non complaint gun owners would have to be prosecuted to increase compliance by X %? I know there can\u2019t be a hard number , but surely studies have been done with other victimless crimes like drugs ?",

Few times in history is there such a great thinker, even less frequent is the ability to live in such a time they are alive.  \n\nHated by progressives and race hustlers alike Thomas Sowell brings forth not only empirical evidence but lived experiences, having lived-for a time- in the literal Jim Crow south, the tools to overcome the eugenic system of oppression the progressive and compassionate cultivate. \n\nI encourage all to delve into opposing viewpoints to learn better, the perspective of those whom you disagree with. As an example I have read multiple time the communist manifesto to better understand the tactic and hatred the the progressives have for my people. Thank you and enjoy. \n\n  #BlackHistory is #AmericanHistory #BlackFreedom is #AmericaFirst #BlackJustice is American #LibertyForAll. #WeThePeople must save #OurRepublic & #Vote for #Democrats & #Republican who will stop both #Progressive benevolent #Racism, #Socalism & #Communisim. #SocalismKills\n\nFiring Line with William F.

I don't know much about DeSantis, save all the noise about vaccines and being opposed to shutdowns. The thing is, some of those right-wingers turned out to be right on a few aspects of COVID. I dunno if I give a rat's ass for DeSantis, but at this stage, I don't know that I don't either. I've studiously avoided the culture war Disney stuff with a \"let them fight\" mindset.  Just saying, though it's up to you dear reader; to consider how you view these primaries and the political lines you take with both DeSantis and RFK Jr in the context of how royally fu3ked we are generally.",

        "text": "Well, after spending a lot of time around people who are classically conservative I'm 100% positive I'm not.\nWhile libertarians (closest thing I am) share a lot of conservative viewpoints, they're quite different in some very key aspects.\nProgressives don't know when to stop being \"progressive\". It's never enough. They don't know when they've won and are downright authoritarian in their positions.\nLiberals are not like this at all. Classic conservatives are a bit like this too, although not nearly as much as I'd previously thought.\nProgressives have no ceiling, they'll gain ground and just keep pushing out of their perceived principle of being progressive, just for the sake of it, logic be damned.\nLiberals are just about freedom. Ya know, liberty? It's in the name ffs.\nClassic conservatives are more about keeping things traditional and the same. They also tend to be very trusting of their government. Libertarians (liberals) on the other hand, have high amounts of distrust for the government and think it should be as limited as possible.\nProgressives are probably the biggest bootlickers I've ever seen. It's fascinating really because they claim to be anti-authority until it's not convenient for them to be and then simultaneously act like the biggest group of authoritarians I've ever seen. These clowns would make Hitler blush, again all the while ironically claiming to be against Nazis. They do a lot of weird projecting too. They also seem to operate in outright lies, purposely too, useful idiots aside. Anything to push the \"progress\", which is ironic because they've gone so far at this point they've hit diminishing returns but don't care as progressives seem to be trapped in a cult. Now I see a lot of that in classic conservatives too but not nearly to the degree of progressives but they also exist. Not all but a lot.\nInterestingly it seems like modern neo-cons are now a combination of liberals/libertarians, disaffected liberals and classic conservatives while what I like to call \"neo-liberals\" are basically the radical left wing which is mostly authoritarian progressives.\nI think that's about the size of it anyway.",

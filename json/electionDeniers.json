Now, the legal standard set by the Judge was to prove it was intentional, not just outcome determinitive, which is a ridiculously unlawful standard. However, it allowed this mountain of evidence to be admitted. This documented fraud is cookie cutter for all major cities.\n\nNow, my personal opinion is that you should petition and present to the legislature for a ruling, not the judicial. But I digress. \n\nThat said, the evidence is officially a matter of record for the world to see. \n\nSo I ask you which of the exhibits shown to in court to break Arizona law and was also shown to be outcome determinative, just not intentional, do you find not to be evidence?\n\nI am waiting.",
